BEVERLY HILLS–Merry Christmas, everybody, and God bless America.
• The Detroit Lions take the field today with the chance to become the first NFL team in history to lose all sixteen of their games. Talk about overpaid. The only people in Detroit who had a lousier year and made more money were the auto executives.
• Federal Express blamed the economy Tuesday when they canceled their Super Bowl ads. It’s not that bad. It’s true that a lot of people are going barefoot in America but at least they’ve enjoyed the satisfaction of throwing something at President Bush.
• Mexico beauty queen Laura Zuniga was arrested for gun smuggling Monday. There was a translation problem. When Mexican police said she was packing a pair of 38s, Americans didn’t know if she was armed or had won the bathing suit competition.
• New York Giants suspended star Plaxico Burress’ house was raided Monday by cops who seized the pants he wore when he accidentally shot himself. There’s a logical explanation for the raid. The cops have plans to start a chain of restaurants called Planet Idiot and these pants will be the first item of memorabilia on the wall.
• Caroline Kennedy was slammed by New York Democrats Wednesday who whisper she’s a royalist. She’s trying to get more connected to the concerns of ordinary people. After her recent listening tour she promised to allow male suffrage throughout Camelot.
• Barack Obama arranged Monday to be sworn into office at the Inaugural with Abe Lincoln’s Bible. It has parables of Jesus urging slaves to be productive. Barack Obama promised he’ll put Americans back to work but he didn’t say we’d get paid for it.
• Wall Street swindler Bernie Madoff was put under house arrest Friday until his trial. He’ll soon be sent to prison and get his room and meals at state expense. Many of his investors have called the judge and offered to serve the sentence for him.
• Bill Clinton took questions at an Apollo Theater event in Harlem on Sunday. He said he’s willing to do anything to help his wife become Secretary of State. The padlock on his zipper has been tough on his bladder but it gives his face great color.
• Hillary Clinton declared in Chicago last week that the era of cowboy diplomacy is over in U.S. foreign affairs. North Korea can’t wait until she’s in charge of enforcing nuclear treaties. There’s already a statue of her in Little Rock looking the other way.
• Dick Cheney was exposed Thursday as responsible for the leak of Valerie Plame’s CIA identity. It was revenge against her husband, who blew the whistle on the false pretext for war in Iraq. It would be nice if we could have one administration that didn’t end with the shredder overheating.
• Dick Cheney defended the Iraq war policy in an interview Tuesday but hinted we didn’t go far enough. His friends say he wanted to invade Iran. When his attorney forced him to give up hunting, the need to shoot something migrated to foreign policy.
• Iran’s president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was allowed by British television to give a Christmas address. He was uncharacteristically humble. Thanks to the collapse of oil prices even Vladimir Putin’s gone back to wearing halter tops in his photo shoots.
• Queen Elizabeth gave her Christmas Day broadcast to the world from Buckingham Palace. She has skillfully ducked the recent financial catastrophes. Whenever the U.S. Treasury Secretary refers to England as the Mother Country, she demands a DNA test.

Upmarket: Madoff's Berkeley Street operation in Mayfair
On bail: Bernie Madoff
AS the financial centres in New York and London continue to grapple with the enormity of Bernie Madoff's $50 billion scam, a single question was increasingly being heard: is there anything left?
Across America, small investors, corporate high rollers and the monied elite wait anxiously to hear if any of the cash they gave Madoff survived his world record-breaking fraud. They were joined by two British banks who are in for £1 billion between them, the City's biggest hedge fund, Man Group, Nicola Horlick's Bramdean Asset Management and fund manager Arpad Busson, among others.
They all want to know what happened to their money. Madoff is out on $10 million bail, posted by his wife Ruth, and he was spotted last night in the window of his duplex on Manhattan's East 64th Street, smoking a large cigar. Understandably, his investors are asking how much Madoff squirrelled away for himself.
Cut to a quiet corner of Mayfair and a set of offices over a smart art gallery. Here, in Berkeley Street, is the headquarters of the US investment veteran's London arm, Madoff Securities International. Compared with his huge Lipstick Building in midtown Manhattan, 12 Berkeley Street is a modest, discreet address. That's exactly how Madoff likes it. A source told the Standard that this anonymous base in Mayfair is Madoff's ""dynastic piggy bank"".
He kept around £80 million in cash in the London firm and used it to fund deals to benefit himself, his wife Ruth and sons Mark and Andrew. The Berkeley Street office is a trading operation, which, by the standards of Madoff's fraud, appears to handle modest sums.But by the standards of even wealthy families it is a powerful money-making tool, worked by a hand-picked staff of 28 including top analysts and investment specialists.
At their head is one of the City's most respected names, Stephen Raven. He was at home in Esher last Thursday night, where he lives with his wife Felicity, when he flicked on the Bloomberg business news and, to his astonishment, discovered Madoff, his old friend and business partner, was accused of being the biggest crook - in money terms - of all time.
Raven is described by his friends as ""old school"". He is 70 now, although he retains the matinee idol looks for which many in the City remember him. He had a distinguished career before joining Madoff. He was on the London Stock Exchange Council for 16 years, sat on the board at Warburgs and was a founding director of Liffe.
The futures market brought him and Madoff together. The American was keen to do business in London and Raven became his chief executive here. The two, while of similar vintage, complement rather than resemble each other. My source said: ""Stephen is charm personified. Madoff can be magnetic but there's a whiff of the backstreets there.""
As Raven watched the Bloomberg report, he grabbed his phone and dialled New York. Every call went to voicemail. He left messages. As of last night, I was told, he was still waiting for an answer.
Raven was staring into blackness. He had spent his life building a reputation of integrity and probity. He ordered a swift statement for the media. It included this: ""Our business activities are not involved in any way with the US asset management company with which the reported allegations appear to be concerned.""
This is true. Madoff used Berkeley Street only to make money for himself and his family. No clients were involved. But Raven knew it would not be long before the question was asked: where did the money to trade come from?
According to someone familiar with the situation, Raven took a decision aimed at protecting the unsuspecting staff of the London office and himself. He froze the company's operations on Friday and called in the authorities. These included investigators from the Financial Services Authority and SOCA, the Serious Organised Crime Agency. SOCA takes a lead role in probing money laundering allegations. The source said: ""Raven wants the operation scrutinised and cleared as quickly as possible.""
Raven has stressed that all trading done from Berkeley Street was carried out with money provided by the Madoff family. Companies House records show the London firm has a share capital of just over £50 million, most of which is held by Bernie Madoff. He also holds the only voting shares.
The Standard was told the operating capital was just over £80 million. If the money is still there - and there is no reason at this stage to suspect it isn't - it may well form part of the assets Madoff's creditors will ultimately claim.
According to US reports, investors' funds were believed to have dwindled to around £200 million when Madoff was interviewed by FBI agents last week. There was a suggestion he had planned to distribute money among his family, friends and most favoured employees before turning himself in but there was no confirmation of this. It was confirmed, however, that he told his sons Mark and Andrew that investors were trying to withdraw $7 billion and the money wasn't there. They called in the FBI.
Madoff allegedly told investigators his financial empire was ""all a big lie"". He added that he had been running a Ponzi scheme - paying clients with money he took from new investors. The received version in the US and Europe was that his investors believed the steady and generous returns he gave them, often contradicting market trends, were the result of his uncanny acuity. They called him ""Magic Madoff"" and believed he had a secret and unique investing strategy.
As the Madoff affair continues to baffle even experts, there is wonderment that he managed to get away with his scam for so long. Madoff operated at many levels. He started his investment business in the 1960s, after raising $5,000 from working as a lifeguard in New Jersey and supplementing his income moonlighting as a fitter of sprinkler systems.
His first investors were family and friends and, even today, he has a strong core of clients who have known him for more than 30 years. They include Joyce Greenberg, from Houston, Texas, whose late husband Jacob was a successful businessman. She was introduced to Madoff by a stepbrother who knew him from college. Since the 1970s Madoff has handled her family's savings. Now she fears the money has gone. ""We never questioned him,"" she said. ""The bookkeeping all added up.""
For people like Mrs Greenberg the statements she received from Madoff's firm seemed to make sense. They did, too, for the wealthy clients he acquired on his social circuit. Madoff and his wife were well liked in the Jewish communities of New York and Palm Beach, Florida. They own a £6 million house that belonged to the Pulitzer family in Palm Beach and they played golf at the local country club set up by wealthy Jewish residents in the 1950s.
Carl J Shapiro, a 95-year-old multi-millionaire and noted philanthropist, is a mainstay of the Palm Beach community. He and his son-in-law, Robert M Jaffe, 64, are long-standing members of the country club and backed Madoff's membership application when he joined in 1996. Shapiro and Jaffe are believed to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars through investing with their friend Madoff.
It was the same story at the Glen Oaks Country Club on Long island, where the Madoffs also played golf. Members here, too, were drawn into the legendary investment scheme but Madoff would not accept anyone. He seemed rather aloof about taking on new clients and his reserve only intensified enthusiasm for getting in on his lucrative act. Barbara Fox, president of a Manhattan estate agency business, said she ""literally begged"" him to take her money but he refused. Others who were not so lucky include Mort Zuckerman, owner of the New York Daily News, and Steven Spielberg, the film director, whose charity the Wunderkinder Foundation was a Madoff client.
So, too, were Fred Wilpon, owner of the New York Mets baseball team, Norman Braman, a major Florida car dealer, and Ezra Merkin, chairman of General Motors financing arm. All these people received Madoff's steady payouts of around 10 per cent a year on their money, apparently regardless of what the markets were doing.
These individuals, and many others, including the financial institutions that invested with Madoff, are sophisticated operators, backed by highly-paid professional advisers. How were they all so successfully duped?
The question is even more pertinent in the light of the warning signs that have been around for years. In 2001 journalist Michael Ocrant wrote a piece in the US that openly questioned Madoff's claims. The article, which has been on the internet for years, pointed to inconsistencies in Madoff's market-defying strategy. Ocrant wrote that ""many expert sceptics"" were bewildered and ""were still grappling to understand how such results have been achieved for so long"".
Not everyone ignored the warning. Jake Walthour, a principal at the hedge fund consulting firm Aksia, said his company had been engaged to investigate Madoff's dealings by a potential investor, shortly after Ocrant's article was published. Walthour told the Associated Press: ""We decided there were several scenarios here, one of which is: this could be a Ponzi scheme. None of our clients invested.""
Yet others flocked to Madoff. His personal wealth has proved hard to estimate but, as well as his Florida mansion and the Manhattan duplex, he also owns a large house in Roslyn, New York, and another on the beachfront at Long Island. He has a 55-foot fishing boat on which he likes to spend weekends with friends and favoured staff.
He is due back in court on Friday but there is no reason to imagine his bail will not be continued and that he will remain free, possibly for many years, as the legal complexities of his self-confessed con trick are unravelled. Madoff is assured his place in history. If nothing else, he will always be the man who proved Warren Buffet's adage that when the tide goes out, you see who is swimming naked.

2,"Is there a bit of Bernie in all of us?
By Jacob Berkman
December 30, 2008 9:43pm
Eugene Robinson writes in the Washington Post that, while 2008 was the year of Barack Obama, it was also the year of Bernard Madoff – because we all have a bit of Bernie in us :
In a sense, we’re all Bernie Madoff. We’ve been running our economy in accordance with his accounting principles for a generation — and now we face a most unpleasant reckoning.
As everyone knows by now, Madoff — once one of the most respected financiers on Wall Street — stands accused of being perhaps the biggest swindler in history. Before his arrest this month, he reportedly told his sons that he had defrauded investors of up to $50 billion. He allegedly followed the playbook written more than eight decades ago by the elegant grifter Charles Ponzi, who used money from new investors to pay juicy returns to old investors. That works fine for a while, but every Ponzi scheme eventually collapses in ruin.
He adds:
But not all of Madoff’s investors could have been in the dark. Some must have realized how unlikely it was that he had found some sort of magical strategy or technique that would always make money, no matter what the financial markets were doing. Some investors, I would wager, must have calculated that they could get in, get their return and get out before the whole thing fell apart.
Which makes me wonder how many of us had our eyes open when housing prices were soaring in Ponzi-like leaps — by 10 percent or more a year, in some parts of the country — while middle-class incomes were largely stagnant. How many of us stopped to ask just who was supposed to be able to pay $1 million for a standard suburban split-level, even if it had an upgraded kitchen with a Sub-Zero fridge?
The whole subprime mortgage industry was based on the idea that housing prices would always rise. Given that assumption, it was perfectly rational for first-time homebuyers to sign up for adjustable-rate mortgages that they couldn’t really afford. From the moment they signed the loan papers, they would be building equity — through appreciation — that soon would make it easy, and lucrative, to refinance or sell.
In other words: Get in, get their return and get out before the whole thing fell apart.  "

* Angry investors gather at headquarters
* Collapse puts pressure on market
* Were red flags ignored?  (Adds information on lawyers retained for suit, and comment from hedge fund Fairfield Greenwich Group)
By Jon Stempel and Christian Plumb
NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Investors scrambled to assess potential losses from an alleged $50 billion fraud by Bernard Madoff, a day after the arrest of the prominent Wall Street trader.
Prosecutors and regulators accused the 70-year-old, who was chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market in the early 1990s, of masterminding a fraud of epic proportions through his investment advisory business, which managed at least one hedge fund.
Hundreds of people, investing with him through the firm's clients, entrusted Madoff with billions of dollars, industry experts said.
""Madoff's investors included captains of industry, corporations -- some of which are publicly traded -- that used Madoff almost as a high-yielding cash management account, endowments, universities, foundations and, importantly, many high-profile funds of funds,"" said Douglas Kass, who heads hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management.
""It appears that at least $15 billion of wealth, much of which was concentrated in southern Florida and New York City, has gone to 'money heaven,'"" he said.
For a list of companies exposed to Madoff's alleged fraud, please see: [ID:nN12471705]
Federal agents arrested Madoff at his apartment on Thursday after prosecutors said he told senior employees that his money management operations were ""all just one big lie"" and ""basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.""
A Ponzi scheme is an illegal investment vehicle that pays off old investors with money from new ones, and is dependent on a constant stream of new investment. Because the invested capital is not earning a sufficient return on its own, such schemes eventually collapse under their own weight.
Madoff is the founder of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, a market-making firm he launched in 1960. His separate investment advisory business had $17.1 billion of assets under management.
'BUSINESS AS USUAL?'
About a dozen angry investors gathered on Friday in the lobby of the Lipstick Building in midtown Manhattan, where the market-making firm and advisory business are headquartered, demanding to know the fate of their money.
One woman said that when she called the firm's offices on Thursday she was told it was ""business as usual.""
Another investor groused, ""Business as usual? Of course it's business as usual. We're getting screwed left and right.""
Police later evicted the small group from the building.
Individual investors were feeling the squeeze elsewhere.
""I expect to get back zero,"" said Floridian Susan Leavitt, who invested through Madoff. ""When he tells the feds he has $200 million to $300 million left out of billions, what can you expect?"" [ID:nN12277760]
Two law firms, Milberg LLP and Seeger Weiss LLP, said Friday they had been retained by ""dozens of individual investors"" in Madoff Securities.
The two most prominent hedge funds that invested with Madoff were the $7.3 billion Fairfield Sentry Ltd, run by Walter Noel's Fairfield Greenwich Group, and the $2.8 billion Kingate Global Fund Ltd, run by Kingate Management Ltd.
Fairfield Greenwich Group said it was trying to determine the extent of potential losses and vowed to pursue recovery of any lost assets. The firm said it had been working with Madoff for nearly 20 years.
Fairfield Sentry and Kingate Global were among a small group of hedge funds to report positive returns for 2008; the average hedge fund was down 18 percent, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.
""People who came to us for portfolio construction were often already invested with Bernie Madoff. He had hundreds of clients,"" said Charles Gradante, who invests in hedge funds as a principal at Hennessee Group LLC. ""Now his whole legacy is destroyed. He was God to people.""
Prior to Madoff's arrest, investors had wondered how he was able to generate annual returns in the low double digits in a variety of market environments. Many questioned how U.S. regulators were able to ignore numerous red flags with regard to Madoff's operations.
""Many of us questioned how that strategy could generate those kinds of returns so consistently,"" said Jon Najarian, an options trader who knows Madoff and is a co-founder of optionmonster.com.
In May 2001, Barron's reported that option strategists for major investment banks said they could not understand how Madoff managed to generate the returns that he did.
""We weren't comfortable with Madoff,"" said Brad Alford, president at investment adviser Alpha Capital in Atlanta. ""We didn't understand how his strategy could generate the kind of returns it did. We will walk away from things like that.""
MORE TO COME?
U.S. stocks tumbled in early trading on Friday, with some investors citing the Madoff case as well as the failure of talks in Congress on a rescue for the U.S. auto industry. The market later rebounded, with the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closing 0.75 percent higher for the day.
Investors overseas were reeling from the alleged fraud.
Benedict Hentsch, a Swiss private bank, said it had 56 million Swiss francs ($47 million) of exposure to Madoff's investment advisory business.
Italian bank UniCredit SpA's (CRDI.MI) fund management unit, Pioneer Investments, has exposure through its Primeo Select hedge fund, two people familiar with the matter said.
Bramdean Alternatives Ltd BRAL.L said almost 10 percent of its holdings were exposed to Madoff, sending shares in the UK asset manager crashing. [ID:nLC388130]
CNBC Television reported that Sterling Equities, which owns the New York Mets baseball team, had accounts managed by Madoff.
'UNFORTUNATE SET OF EVENTS'
Madoff said ""there is no innocent explanation"" for his activities, and that he ""paid investors with money that wasn't there,"" according to the federal complaint.
Prosecutors also accused Madoff of wanting to distribute as much as $300 million to employees, family members and friends before turning himself in.
Charged with one count of securities fraud, he faces up to 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed separate civil charges.
A hearing had been scheduled for Friday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on the SEC's request to grant powers to the court-appointed receiver to oversee the entire firm, as well as on the commission's request for a firmwide asset freeze.
But the hearing was canceled after the matter was resolved, said a deputy for U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton. No other details were immediately available. The receiver, lawyer Lee Richards, had been appointed by the judge on Thursday to oversee assets and accounts of the firm held abroad.
Madoff's lawyer, Dan Horwitz, said on Thursday: ""We will fight to get through this unfortunate set of events."" His client was released on $10 million bond.
Madoff is a member of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc's (NDAQ.O) nominating committee. His firm has said it is a market-maker for about 350 Nasdaq stocks.
He is also chairman of London-based Madoff Securities International Ltd, whose chief executive, Stephen Raven, said the firm was ""not in any way part of"" the New York-based market-maker.
All equity trades involving the market-making firm will be processed as usual, the Depository Trust Clearing Corp told Reuters on Friday. [ID:nWEN1811]

5,"1903: Storyville, New Orleans' red-light district, was famous
View/Post Comments
Storyville was established July 6, 1897, in an attempt by the New Orleans City Council to control rampant prostitution in the city by limiting it to a 38-block area on the edge of the French Quarter. Mansions, saloons and low-cost ""cribs"" lined the streets of Storyville, which New Orleanians nicknamed after the alderman who introduced the measure, Sidney Story.

Storyville, bounded by Customhouse (Iberville), North Basin (North Saratoga), St. Louis and North Robertson streets, operated until Nov. 12, 1917. U.S. military officials convinced the city that Storyville was a bad influence for WWI troops stationed near New Orleans.
In the district's heyday, property owners, madames, liquor retailers and other anonymous interested parties published guides to the red-light district, known as Blue Books, from 1898 to 1915.
E.J. Bellocq documented Storyville's prostitutes through a series of portraits, discovered after his death in 1949. The photographs, taken in the early 1900s, showcase the lives and work of women who often existed on society's fringes.
Little is known about Bellocq's life, but his photographs have inspired several fictional portrayals of him in books and movies, including 1978's ""Pretty Baby."" The film, which starred a 12-year-old Brooke Shields, was filmed in New Orleans at the Columns Hotel.
A visit to Storyville, New Orleans' most famous red light  district Storyville opened as part of a reform effort to regulate vice in New Orleans in 1897. LSU history professor and Storyville expert Alecia P. Long explains how it all came about in this video.
Lulu White was one of the most famous madames in Storyville. Her brothel, the four-story Mahogany Hall, employed 40 prostitutes and contained 15 bedrooms and five parlors. White was often in trouble with the law. Though most of her charges were related to serving liquor without a license and running an ""immoral house,"" she was also known to grow violent when patrons threatened her business or her employees.
Tom Anderson, a businessman and politician known as the mayor of Storyville, owned several restaurants, saloons and brothels in the area. When Storyville was shuttered, Anderson's heyday ended. In 1920, he was charged in federal court with knowingly conducting an immoral resort within 10 miles of a military camp. The charge was eventually dropped.
Storyville played a role in jazz history. Pianist Jelly Roll Morton was one of the iconic musicians who got his start playing in Storyville's brothels and saloons.

Anche per questo, l’editore ha deciso di investire ulteriormente sulla piattaforma.
L’arrivo di Star però segna un cambio nel prezzo dell’abbonamento: dal 23 febbraio, il prezzo dell’abbonamento a Disney+ sarà 8,99 euro al mese o 89,90 euro all’anno. Il nuovo prezzo sarà in vigore per i nuovi abbonati dal 23 febbraio 2021.
Chi ha già un abbonamento annuale o mensile potrà godere dell’offerta completa di Star senza alcun incremento di prezzo fino al primo rinnovo successivo al 22 agosto.
Che cos’è e cosa offrirà Star
Il nuovo brand di Disney+ non si presenta solo come un contenitore inedito sulla piattaforma di streaming, ma anche come un ambizioso progetto di produzioni originali italiane ed europee.
Nello specifico, le produzioni originali Star italiane sono diverse: si va dalla quarta stagione della serie cult comedy Boris, alla serie tv tratta dall’omonimo film Le Fate Ignoranti di Ferzan Ozpetek, regista anche della serie, e alla serie crime basata su una storia vera, The Good Mothers.
In contemporanea, The Walt Disney Company Emea ha rivelato la lista degli Original europei per Disney+, a conferma dell’impegno della Company a ideare, sviluppare e realizzare in Europa nuove produzioni originali. Famosi e pluripremiati creatori e produttori porteranno su Disney+ un ampio numero di storie europee con rilevanza locale che si aggiungeranno all’offerta di intrattenimento già conosciuta e amata dagli abbonati.
I primi dieci progetti commissionati da Disney+, sia per il brand Disney che per l’imminente arrivo del brand di intrattenimento generale Star, rappresentano il primo passo verso l’ambizioso progetto di Disney+ di ordinare 50 produzioni in Europa entro il 2024.
I progetti abbracciano diversi generi: drama, comedy, sci-fi e documentari e hanno avuto il via libera in Italia, Francia, Germania e nei Paesi Bassi, insieme a molti altri progetti in fase di sviluppo.
Da un thriller dedicato alla ‘ndrangheta con un cast al femminile, a un incredibile supernatural mistery, da potenti storie vere a un romantic drama, queste sono le nuove produzioni europee che aggiungeranno a Disney+ uno storytelling locale di alta qualità, garantendo sempre contenuti per tutti i gusti.
Diego Londono, EVP, Media Networks and Content, The Walt Disney Company EMEA ha così commentato: “La strategia di commissioning mette in luce il nostro impegno nella produzione di contenuti originali di prim’ordine, creati specificamente per i mercati locali ma dotati dell’ambizione creativa necessaria a catturare l’attenzione degli spettatori di tutto il mondo. A livello globale, l’Europa è considerata una straordinaria potenza creativa e questo, unito alla grande esperienza Disney nel campo dello storytelling di alta qualità e ai suoi rapporti con alcuni dei migliori talenti dell’intrattenimento, renderà Disney+ la destinazione ideale in Europa per trovare contenuti interessanti e coinvolgenti”.
Il nuovo Parental Control
In aggiunta ai contenuti eccezionali già disponibili su Disney+, Star porterà una vasta scelta di serie e film per famiglie, ragazzi e adulti. E per garantire che Disney+ sia adatto a un pubblico di tutte le età, il servizio di streaming introduce dal prossimo 23 febbraio un sistema di parental control per offrire sempre un'esperienza di visione adatta a tutti i membri della famiglia. Oltre al “Profilo Bambini” già presente sulla piattaforma, gli abbonati potranno impostare dei limiti di accesso ai contenuti per un pubblico più adulto e creare profili con accesso tramite PIN, per garantire massima tranquillità ai genitori.
Al primo accesso a Disney+ dopo il lancio di Star, agli abbonati verrà chiesto se desiderano attivare l'accesso ai contenuti per un pubblico più adulto, impostando la classificazione sul proprio profilo da 14+ a 18+.

7,"The matter of an empty tomb
Saturday, 13 August 2011 14:21 administrator
No serious historian really doubts Jesus was dead when he was taken down from the cross. However, many have questioned how Jesus’ body disappeared from the tomb. English journalist Dr Frank Morison initially thought the resurrection was either a myth or a hoax, and he began research to write a book refuting it. The book became famous but for reasons other than its original intent.
Morison began by attempting to solve the case of the empty tomb. The tomb belonged to a member of the Sanhedrin Council, Joseph of Arimathea. In Israel at that time, to be on the council was to be a rock star. Everyone knew who was on the council. Joseph must have been a real person. Otherwise, the Jewish leaders would have exposed the story as a fraud in their attempt to disprove the resurrection. Also, Joseph’s tomb would have been at a well-known location and easily identifiable, so any thoughts of Jesus being “lost in the graveyard” would need to be dismissed.
Morison wondered why Jesus’ enemies would have allowed the “empty tomb myth” to persist if it weren’t true. The discovery of Jesus’ body would have instantly killed the entire plot.
And what is known historically of Jesus’ enemies is that they accused Jesus’ disciples of stealing the body, an accusation clearly predicated on a shared belief that the tomb was empty.
Dr Paul L. Maier, professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University, similarly stated, “If all the evidence is weighed carefully and fairly, it is indeed justifiable ... to conclude that the tomb in which Jesus was buried was actually empty on the morning of the first Easter. And no shred of evidence has yet been discovered ... that would disprove this statement.”
The Jewish leaders were stunned. They accused the disciples of stealing Jesus’ body. But the Romans had assigned a 24-hour watch at the tomb with a trained guard unit (from 4 to 12 soldiers). Morison asked, “How could these professionals have let Jesus’ body be vandalised?” It would have been impossible for anyone to have slipped by the Roman guards and to have moved a two-tonne stone. Yet the stone was moved away and the body of Jesus was missing.
If Jesus’ body was anywhere to be found, his enemies would have quickly exposed the resurrection as a fraud. Tom Anderson, former president of the California Trial Lawyers Association, summarizes the strength of this argument: “With an event so well publicised, don’t you think that it’s reasonable that one historian, one eye witness, one antagonist would record for all time that he had seen Christ’s body? ... The silence of history is deafening when it comes to the testimony against the resurrection.”
So, with no body of evidence, and with a known tomb clearly empty, Morison accepted the evidence as solid that Jesus’ body had somehow disappeared from the tomb.
Grave robbing?
As Morison continued his investigation, he began to examine the motives of Jesus’ followers. Maybe the supposed resurrection was actually a stolen body. But if so, how does one account for all the reported appearances of a resurrected Jesus? Historian Paul Johnson in History of the Jews wrote, “What mattered was not the circumstances of his death but the fact that he was widely and obstinately believed, by an expanding circle of people, to have risen again.”
The tomb was indeed empty. But it wasn’t the mere absence of a body that could have galvanised Jesus’ followers (especially if they had been the ones who had stolen it). Something extraordinary must have happened, for the followers of Jesus ceased mourning, ceased hiding, and began fearlessly proclaiming that they had seen Jesus alive.
Each eyewitness account reports that Jesus suddenly appeared bodily to his followers, the women first. Morison wondered why conspirators would make women central to its plot. In the first century, women had virtually no rights, personhood, or status. If the plot were to succeed, Morison reasoned, the conspirators would have portrayed men, not women, as the first to see Jesus alive. And yet we hear that women touched him, spoke with him, and were the first to find the empty tomb.
Later, according to the eyewitness accounts, all the disciples saw Jesus on more than ten separate occasions. They wrote that he showed them his hands and feet and told them to touch him. And he reportedly ate with them and later appeared alive to more than 500 followers on one occasion.
Legal scholar John Warwick Montgomery stated, “In 56 A.D. [the Apostle Paul wrote that over 500 people had seen the risen Jesus and that most of them were still alive (1 Corinthians 15:6). It passes the bounds of credibility that the early Christians could have manufactured such a tale and then preached it among those who might easily have refuted it simply by producing the body of Jesus.”
Bible scholars Geisler and Turek agree. “If the Resurrection had not occurred, why would the Apostle Paul give such a list of supposed eyewitnesses? He would immediately lose all credibility with his Corinthian readers by lying so blatantly.”

Bernie Madoff: World’s Most Honest Fraudster
The most shocking aspect of the Madoff saga isn’t the crimes he’s accused of—it’s the lack of a cover-up.
Eric  Dezenhall
12.15.08 8:45 AM ET
I’ve made my living in the peculiar art of crisis management for more than a quarter century, so I’m rarely surprised when I read about disasters such as the alleged geothermal fraud of investor Bernard Madoff.
Specifically, what floored me about the Madoff coverage were the reports that he had conceded to his sons and associates that “it was all just one big lie.” My experience with these affairs is that the accused uber-gonif tells everyone who will listen, including his legal and damage control team, that the charges against him are “total bullshit.” Not that some of the allegations are wrong; rather Virtually Every Negative Thing Being Said About Me Is 100% Certified Grade-A Imported Bullshit.
No sane attorney would sanction an out-of-the-gate mea culpa if there was any chance their client might secure his liberty (or his house in Southampton).
While Madoff’s reported confession is cold comfort to those investors, and, monstrously, the charities that invested with him, it is, nevertheless, an interesting clinical development in the science of crisis management.
For decades – I trace it back to Watergate – pundits and journalists have trafficked in the twin canards: “Fess up and the problem will go away” and “It’s the cover up that nails you.”
The truth is more banal and depressing. The reasons scandal figures don’t fess up is that they don’t believe they did anything wrong, and, perhaps most tactically, confessions and expressions of remorse are usually admissible in criminal and civil court. Enough rapscallions have been acquitted, or negotiated attractive pleas, that no sane attorney would sanction an out-of-the-gate mea culpa if there was any chance their client might secure his liberty (or his house in Southampton).
A similar logic applies to the “it’s the cover-up that gets you” bromide. As the late George Carlin once observed, “People in Washington say it’s not the initial offense that gets you into trouble, it’s the cover-up. They say you should admit what you did, get the story out and move on. What this overlooks is the fact that most of the time the cover-up works just fine, and nobody finds out a damned thing.”
Implicit in Carlin’s message is that admissions don’t make your victims and the public want to forgive you, they make them want to kill you. Furthermore, not all cover-ups are cover-ups in the criminal sense. The same kind of breathtaking confidence and lack of self-awareness that it takes to tell one’s associates that “it’s all bullshit” also enables charismatic thieves to build Potemkin Villages in the first place.
This brings us to the subtext of most of these financial scandals: Why do smart people who instinctively hang up on telemarketers believe in self-promoting gurus promising geometric returns? Greed and naiveté are the convenient explanations, and I expect that most of the charities that lost money with Madoff had the noblest motives.
Still, there is another pathology operating here: The need to believe in shamans and gurus is often tied to the aspiration of the successful for the cross-validation that comes from inclusion in an ultra-elite club. Put differently, to invest with a wizard is to be among the Wizard Class, to be one of The Chosen elected to benefit from inside shibboleths.
Perhaps the most diabolically clever aspect of Madoff’s pitch was not his promise of outrageous returns, but his promise of exclusivity – the notion that he actively rejected unworthy clients in the manner that the Ivy League rejects second-tier applicants. It is of no small consequence that Madoff conducted much of his business at highly selective country clubs.
Nobody wants to be the rube that listens to a Madoffian pitch only to raise his hand and say, “I don’t get it.” Better to fork over your life savings to a top-drawer shuck-and-jive artist than announce you’ve decided just to pay off your mortgage instead (to the sniggering of financial sophisticates about how you’re pissing away a tax deduction, you community college nimrod). As Professor Marvel admonishes Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, “Professor Marvel never guesses. He knows!” The good professor, of course, is played by the same actor who demands that Dorothy and her cohort “pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,” who turns out to be nothing but the fraudulent Wizard of Oz himself.
I routinely see this desire for wizards in my crisis management work. When mega-successful companies or individuals get in trouble they seek attorneys and PR people whom they believe will throw pixie dust in the eyes of the judge, jury and the New York Times, resulting in acquittal and, perhaps, a comeback cover of Fortune.
There is, of course, no pixie dust, just good and bad facts, good and bad laws, and plausible narratives and laughable whoppers. If Madoff’s reputed confession turns out to be true, it will be a lousy legal strategy. But I would like to think it could represent a turning point in our culture’s ethical and spiritual management of malfeasance. Might would-be felons realize that the consequences of swindle won’t be the successful obfuscation of a magician, but the abject surrender of a petty thief?
I am not optimistic. I see no evidence that people learn from the mistakes of fallen icons, which one would think are self-evident—Ivan Boesky, Dennis Kozlowski, et al. Alas, these guys were different.
I suspect that Madoff’s confession is an aberration borne out of the visceral catharsis that occurs when the Joker in the deck suddenly turns up -- the Joker that precedes a catastrophic depression.
Trust me. Like Professor Marvel, I know.

Business Day |Prominent Trader Accused of Defrauding Clients

Continue reading the main story
On Wall Street, his name is legendary. With money he had made as a lifeguard on the  beaches of Long Island, he built a trading powerhouse that had prospered for more than four decades. At age 70, he had become an influential spokesman for the traders who are the hidden gears of the marketplace.
But on Thursday morning, this consummate trader, Bernard L. Madoff, was arrested at his Manhattan home by federal agents who accused him of running a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme — perhaps the largest in Wall Street’s history.
Regulators have not yet verified the scale of the fraud. But the criminal complaint filed against Mr. Madoff on Thursday in federal court in Manhattan reports that he estimated the losses at $50 billion. “We are alleging a massive fraud — both in terms of scope and duration,” said Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of the enforcement division at the Securities and Exchange Commission. “We are moving quickly and decisively to stop the fraud and protect remaining assets for investors.”
Andrew M. Calamari, an associate director for enforcement in the S.E.C.’s regional office in New York, said the case involved “a stunning fraud that appears to be of epic proportions.”

According to his lawyers, Mr. Madoff was released on a $10 million bond. “Bernie Madoff is a longstanding leader in the financial services industry,” said Daniel Horwitz, one of his lawyers. “He will fight to get through this unfortunate set of events.”

Mr. Madoff’s brother and business colleague, Peter Madoff, declined to comment on the case or discuss its implications for the Madoff firm, which at one point was the largest market maker on the electronic Nasdaq market, regularly operating as both a buyer and seller of a host of widely traded securities. The firm employed hundreds of traders.
There was some worry on Wall Street that Mr. Madoff’s fall would shake more foundations than his own.
According to the most recent federal filings, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, the firm he founded in 1960, operated more than two dozen funds overseeing $17 billion.

These funds have been widely marketed to wealthy investors, hedge funds and other institutional customers for more than a decade, although an S.E.C. filing in the case said the firm reported having 11 to 23 clients at the beginning of this year.

At the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a federal judge appointed a receiver on Thursday evening to secure the Madoff firm’s overseas accounts and warned the firm not to move any assets until he had ruled on whether to freeze the assets.

A hearing on that request is scheduled for Friday.
Regulators said they hoped to have a clearer picture of the losses facing investors by that court hearing.
“We have 16 examiners on site all day and through the night poring over the records,” said Mr. Calamari of the S.E.C.
The Madoff funds attracted investors with the promise of  high returns and low fees. One of Mr. Madoff’s more prominent funds, the Fairfield Sentry fund, reported having $7.3 billion in assets in October and claimed to have paid more than 11 percent interest each year through its 15-year track record.

Competing hedge fund managers have wondered privately for years how Mr. Madoff generated such high returns, in bull markets and bear, given the generally low-yielding investment strategies he described to his clients.

“The numbers were too good to be true, for too long,” said Girish Reddy, a managing director at Prisma Partners, an investment firm that invests in hedge funds. “And the supporting infrastructure was weak.” Mr. Reddy said his firm had looked at the Madoff funds but decided against investing in them because their performance was too consistently positive, even in times when the market was incredibly volatile.

But the essential drama is a personal one — one laid out in the dry language of a criminal complaint by Lev L. Dassin, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, and a regulatory lawsuit filed by the S.E.C. According to those documents, the first alarm bells rang at the firm on Tuesday, when Mr. Madoff told a senior executive he wanted to pay his employees their annual bonuses in December, two months early.
Just days earlier, Mr. Madoff had told another senior executive he was struggling to raise cash to cover about $7 billion in requested withdrawals from his clients, and he had appeared “to have been under great stress in the prior weeks,” according to the S.E.C. complaint.

So on Wednesday, the senior executive visited Mr. Madoff’s office, maintained on a separate floor with records kept under lock and key, and asked for an explanation.
Instead, Mr. Madoff invited the two executives to his Manhattan apartment that evening. When they joined him there, he told them that his money-management business was “all just one big lie” and “basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.”

The senior employees understood him to be saying that he had for years been paying returns to certain investors out of the cash received from other investors.
In that conversation, according to the criminal complaint, Mr. Madoff “stated that he was ‘finished,’ that he had ‘absolutely nothing.’ ”

By this account, Mr. Madoff told the executives he intended to surrender to the authorities in about a week but first wanted to distribute approximately $200 million to $300 million to “certain selected employees, family and friends.”

On Thursday morning, however, he was arrested on a single count of securities fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $5 million.
According to the S.E.C., Mr. Madoff confessed to an F.B.I. agent that there was “no innocent explanation” for his behavior and he expected to go to jail. He had lost money on his trades, he told the agent, and had “paid investors with money that wasn’t there.”

Although not a household name, Mr. Madoff’s firm has played a significant role in the structure of Wall Street for decades, both in traditional stock trading and in the development of newer electronic networks for trading equities and derivatives .

Continue reading the main story
In building those new trading networks, his firm had formed partnerships with some of the largest brokerage businesses on Wall Street, including Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch.
Mr. Madoff founded Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities in 1960 and liked to tell interviewers about earning his initial stake by working as a lifeguard at city beaches and installing underground sprinkler systems.
By the early 1980s, his firm was one of the largest independent trading operations in the securities industry. The company had around $300 million in assets in 2000 at the height of the Internet bubble and ranked among the top trading and securities firms in the nation.

Mr. Madoff ran the business with several family members, including his brother Peter, his nephew Charles, his niece Shana and his sons Mark and Andrew.

Affaire de la sex-tape: la demande d'annulation de l'enquête examinée vendredi par la justice
12/10/2016 11:27
suivante précédente
Banales techniques d'enquêteur ou égarement d'un limier pousse-au-crime ? La justice examine vendredi les méthodes policières employées dans l'enquête sur la tentative de chantage à la sex-tape contre Mathieu Valbuena, jugées déloyales par les suspects, dont Karim Benzema, qui réclament l'annulation de l'ensemble de la procédure.
La chambre de l'instruction de la cour d'appel de Versailles doit notamment se pencher sur la validité d'une des pièces maîtresses du dossier: les négociations téléphoniques entre un policier qui se faisait passer pour un homme de confiance de Valbuena, ""M. Lucas"", et un maître chanteur.
En juin 2015, Valbuena avait reçu un appel d'un inconnu lui affirmant détenir une vidéo intime le concernant. Le maître-chanteur lui proposait de trouver un arrangement, sans évoquer le montant à payer, conduisant le footballeur à déposer plainte.
Une longue négociation avait alors commencé entre le policier sous couverture et l'escroc, nourrie d'appels téléphoniques répétés, certains à l'initiative de l'enquêteur qui relançait avec insistance le maître chanteur.
""C'est une provocation à l'infraction: on ne saura jamais ce qui se serait passé si le policier n'avait pas rappelé"", soutient l'avocat du corbeau, Me Marion Ménage qui, au-delà de l'annulation de cette seule pièce, demande que tous les actes de procédure postérieurs tombent - soit l'ensemble du dossier.
L'enquête avait ensuite permis d'identifier les deux cerveaux présumés de l'entreprise de chantage: Mustapha Zouaoui et Axel Angot, qui gravitent depuis des années autour des footballeurs.
Pour l'avocat du premier, Me Serge Money, ""il y a eu déloyauté: ce policier s'est emballé, il a été virulent, il a poussé (le corbeau) à donner des preuves, il lui demande combien il veut... On a l'impression qu'il voulait monter un beau dossier"".
Zouaoui et Angot s'étaient ensuite tournés vers Karim Zenati, un ami d'enfance de Karim Benzema, attaquant au Real Madrid et co-équipier de Valbuena en équipe de France, afin qu'il fasse pression sur le joueur de l'Olympique lyonnais et le convainque de payer.
Tous ont été mis en exmaen pour tentative de chantage, complicité et participation à une association de malfaiteurs.
Benzema, privé d'Euro-2016 en raison de cette affaire, est toutefois désormais ""sélectionnable"" en équipe de France, a estimé la semaine dernière le président de la Fédération française de football, Noël le Graët.
Cissé mis en examen ?
Les magistrats de la chambre de l'instruction doivent également examiner vendredi une demande, formulée par le parquet, de mise en examen de l'ex-footballeur Djibril Cissé, qui avait fait état à Valbuena dès mai 2015 de ""murmures"" quant à la circulation d'une vidéo.
Placé en garde à vue à l'automne 2015, Cissé en était ressorti libre, sans aucune charge contre lui, après avoir convaincu les enquêteurs de sa bonne foi.
L'accusation a depuis changé d'avis: ""des éléments médiatiques laissent perplexes quant à la bienveillance de Cissé à l'égard de Valbuena"", notamment ""son intervention dans l'émission Touche pas à mon poste"" sur D8, a expliqué à l'AFP une source proche du dossier.
Lors de cette prestation télévisée d'octobre 2015, Cissé avait expliqué que ""(c'était) un truc qui aurait pu être très mauvais pour moi et pour (Mathieu Valbuena) alors qu'il n'y a rien. On est venu me chercher pour écouter ma partie de l'histoire. Moi je n'ai jamais escroqué personne. Mathieu est un ami!""
Insuffisant, toutefois, pour la juge d'instruction Nathalie Boutard (depuis remplacée par une nouvelle magistrate à la tête de l'enquête, Christelle Boynton), qui avait jugé inutile toute poursuite. Le parquet a fait appel de ce refus.
De même, les juges d'appel sont saisis vendredi de diverses demandes: le parquet exige notamment une confrontation entre Zouaoui, Angot et Cissé, une autre entre Valbuena et Cissé. La défense de Benzema réclame pour sa part l'audition des internationaux français Patrice Evra et Raphaël Varane, ainsi qu'une quinzaine de pontes de l'équipe de France, du sélectionneur Didier Deschamps au cuisinier, responsable des contenus numériques et ostéopathe compris.

Ex-lawmaker guilty of bribery
ANCHORAGE — A former Alaskan lawmaker was convicted of bribery yesterday for getting thousands of dollars out of a corrections-company consultant in exchange for his help in the Legislature.
“I’m devastated,” former state Rep. Tom Anderson said after the federal jury announced its verdict. Anderson , 39, was accused of conspiring to take money that he thought was coming from a private prison firm, Cornell Industries, Inc.
The money was supplied by the FBI through an informant working for Cornell who secretly recorded his conversations with Anderson and a co-conspirator, former municipal lobbyist Bill Bobrick. Judge John Sedwick ordered Anderson to surrender his passport and scheduled sentencing for Oct. 2.

Bus strike disrupts morning commute
SANTA ANA — Orange County’s first bus strike in more than two decades disrupted the morning commute for thousands of riders yesterday after 1,100 transportation workers walked off the job.
The strike began Saturday after union leaders rejected a proposed contract offer.
Only 31 of the county’s 81 bus lines were still running, most of them short routes and rail feeders operated by a subcontractor. Transit officials were bracing for plenty of confusion and frustrated residents.
“We’re really hopeful this won’t be a long-term situation. We want the union to come back and talk to us,” said transit spokesman Joel Zlotnik.
Orange County Transportation Authority board members were to meet yesterday to discuss their next move, and members of the union picketed outside the transit headquarters. Both sides agreed yesterday morning to resume negotiations later in the day, which Mr. Zlotnik called a positive step.
About 70 percent of the public-transportation riders don’t have access to a car.
The drivers are demanding a 14 percent pay raise spread over three years.

12,"Madoff case to rock already shaky hedge funds

Hedge Funds »
BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bernard Madoff has single-handedly turned an already very bad year for hedge funds into a catastrophe.
Now the industry's already steep losses may grow even larger, dozens of funds might collapse and confidence eroded even more after a 70-year old New York-based investor allegedly cheated investors from Palm Beach, to New York, to Geneva to Madrid out of as much as $50 billion (33 billion pounds).
""You already have a crisis of confidence because of the falling stock market,"" said Charles Gradante, who selects hedge funds for clients as a co-founder of the Hennessee Group.
""Now that crisis has broadened to hedge funds directly because Bernie Madoff seems to have pulled off a gigantic fraud for so many years.""
Panicked hedge fund investors hearing tales of how Madoff cheated his clients might worry they cannot trust their own managers either, investors and industry lawyers said.
""If this had happened any earlier in the year, you would have seen even more people trying to run for the exits,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisor.
The $1.5 trillion industry has been flooded with redemption notices for months as investors react to the industry's deepest ever losses of 18 percent.
Indeed, the panic will likely spread into next year.
""Anyone on the fence regarding redemptions to the fund industry over the next several months will likely put in their requests for capital withdrawal, as confidence in the system and in investment managers has been irreparably impaired,"" said Doug Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management.
For years Madoff played the part of a solid investment manager by boasting on his website about the firm's ""unblemished record of value, fair-dealing and high ethical standards.""
His office was filled with computer banks, there was little paper and he reflected the industry's reputation for secrecy by telling would-be investors very little about how he worked, people who know him remembered.
""Madoff's outfit was such a black box,"" said Salomon Konig, who helps endowments and wealthy families select hedge funds as chief investment officer at Artemis Capital Partners.
Konig was so worried that he told funds of hedge funds he was not interested in doing business with them if they were involved with with Madoff, a society lion known for his affable manner at charity functions.
But plenty of other investors were less careful and downright eager to invest with Madoff, whose records showed he lost money in only five of 156 months, several people familiar with his clientele said.
Tremont Capital was an early fan, the people said. Also hedge funds Fairfield Sentry, run by Walter Noel, and Kingate Global Fund, were known as feeder funds for Madoff. And Spanish group BBVA had offered U.S. based advisors a chance to put their clients' money in his hands.
As the list of people linked with Madoff grows, industry experts believe the pain will be felt far and wide.
""This will be a who's who of people caught with him,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors.
Already rumors are swirling about funds that will be wiped out by the alleged fraud.
""Is this going to be the nail in the coffin for a few hedge funds already teetering on the edge, I absolutely think so,"" said Peter Turecek, a managing director at Kroll Inc, a risk consultancy owned by Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc.
Another major result from the Madoff case will be an increase in hedge fund surveillance.
""A lot of people treat due diligence as a check the box kind of endeavor and this is a poster-child case for why you need to do real due diligence,"" Turecek added."

David Fulmer's second novel starring the Creole detective Valentin St. Cyr is set in New Orleans in 1908, when the new music called ""jass"" has electrified the brothels and bars of Storyville. The author says the term ""jass"" may have come from jaser, French for ""chatter""; or perhaps from jasi, ""party"" in the Mandingo language of West Africa. How ""jass"" then became ""jazz"" is not explained, but Fulmer gives this glimpse of the state of the art at that moment, just after the legendary jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden suffered a breakdown and entered a mental institution:
""The jass the band was playing had only crossed over Canal Street within the year. Before then, it would have been heard only in low-down dives and dance halls out on Rampart Street. This was where Bolden and his gang had started it all, grabbing up gutbucket, ragtime, church music, cakewalks, and anything else they could find, mixing it up, and shoving it through the bells of their loud horns. It was something no one had ever heard before, raw and raucous, noisy and fast. First the Negroes went wild for it, then it was the Creoles, and then the American New Orleans got the fever.""
As Fulmer tells it, respectable New Orleans viewed jass much as respectable America would view rock-and-roll 50 years later: They saw it as the devil's music, threatening to corrupt the young and bring on the decline of the West, but they were consoled by the thought that it was clearly a fad that would never last.
With Bolden gone, the major jazz figure in the novel is the young Jelly Roll Morton, who plays piano in a brothel and is friendly with St. Cyr. The detective works as the eyes and ears for Tom Anderson, the state senator and bar owner who is known as the King of Storyville and is considered the most powerful man in New Orleans. In ""Chasing the Devil's Tail,"" which won a Shamus Award for a best first novel, St. Cyr solved a series of murders of sporting girls, or ""soiled doves,"" in Storyville. This time, the victims are jass musicians.
At the outset, Morton warns St. Cyr that two musicians have been killed within a week, perhaps by the Ku Klux Klan or other white-supremacist groups who hate their music. At first the detective thinks the deaths are happenstance, brought on by drugs or fights over women. But after two more murders St. Cyr starts to investigate, only to find a police lieutenant and even his boss, Tom Anderson, trying to pressure him off the case. But St. Cyr is a stubborn fellow and pushes ahead.
Fulmer's mystery plot is adequate, but the strength of his novel is his vivid portrait of a great city at one of its most exciting moments. He gives us some of the history of the red-light district that was eventually named for an alderman,  Sidney Story: ""Since the battalion of prostitutes swarmed to New Orleans in the wake of Andrew Jackson's ragtag army of 1812, red lanterns had been hung in the windows of the shacks of wanton women as a sign of invitation to pleasures of the flesh."" Fulmer cares about jazz and shows its birth in a corrupt, violent, bigoted world, but music is only one element in a broad canvas that includes politics, poverty, prejudice, crime, drugs, voodoo and the interaction between the city's rich and the women of color who became their mistresses.
At the center of the portrait is the melancholy St. Cyr, walking along such fabled streets as Magazine, Basin, Rampart, Burgundy and Royal, brooding about the unhappy past when his father was murdered and his mother disappeared. There is a vast sadness to his life. One night he goes to visit the graves of his brother and sister, who died young in the yellow fever epidemic of the 1880s: ""Valentin felt the silence engulf him like a dark hand. As he stood there, the moon came out to wash the city of the dead in silver."" His mistress, ""the cafe-au-lait dove named Justine,"" has lived with St. Cyr for more than a year, but they quarrel, and she returns to her previous life, becoming the kept woman of a rich businessman, only to find that ""She thought him a fool and a weakling, and she could not be the mistress of such a man for life. She could not bear his colored children. She could not live in a prison on Girod Street for his pleasure and her wealth. Let someone else accept that sentence.""
In solving the case of the murdered musicians, St. Cyr makes so many enemies that he is last seen on a train out of town. Fulmer is a graceful, evocative writer, and if you love New Orleans and its music, his novel summons up sweet memories that have nothing to do with serial killers. I have no idea where Fulmer is going with his series, but it is worth noting that Louis Armstrong, age 7 or so, makes a cameo appearance as one of the waifs who run errands for St. Cyr. If Fulmer wants to move forward 10 or 15 years, a portrait of that particular artist as a young man, with his genius starting to blossom, might be the greatest of all New Orleans stories."

« Qu'est-ce que le Premier ministre fait de la présomption d'innocence ?  s’emporte l’avocat sur RTL . Cette affaire se déroule aujourd'hui dans les médias de façon absolument scandaleuse, qui conduit le Premier ministre à se prononcer sur une affaire dont il ne connaît absolument rien.

Mardi 20 juin 2017
Mathieu Valbuena et Karim Benzema, sous le maillot des Bleus avant un match amical contre la Jamaïque, le 8 juin 2014  - PHILIPPE HUGUEN (AFP/Archives)
Le footballeur Karim Benzema conteste mardi devant la Cour de cassation la validité de l'enquête dans l'affaire de tentative de chantage à la sex-tape contre Mathieu Valbuena, dans laquelle il est mis en examen.
Mi-décembre dernier, la cour d'appel de Versailles a validé des écoutes litigieuses entre un corbeau, qui avait appelé Valbuena en affirmant détenir une vidéo intime le concernant, et un policier sous couverture qui s'était fait passer pour l'homme de main de Valbuena.
Karim Benzema, tout comme un autre des protagonistes du dossier, Karim Zenati, un ami d'enfance de Benzema, a formé un pourvoi en cassation, estimant que le policier avait utilisé des méthodes pousse-au-crime.
Dans son avis avant l'audience, l'avocat général préconise le rejet du pourvoi et donc pour la validation de la procédure, selon une source proche du dossier.
L'affaire avait débuté en juin 2015, lorsque Valbuena avait reçu un appel de cet inconnu. Le maître-chanteur proposait au milieu offensif de l'Olympique lyonnais de trouver un arrangement, sans évoquer le montant à payer, conduisant l'international français à déposer plainte.
Une négociation avait commencé entre un policier et l'escroc.
Un mois plus tôt, Djibril Cissé avait fait part à Valbuena de ""murmures"", en évoquant l'existence de cette vidéo supposément compromettante. Il a été mis en examen fin février.
La justice cherche notamment à savoir dans quelles conditions Djibril Cissé a pris connaissance de la vidéo incriminée, à savoir si il l'a seulement visionnée ou s'il l'a téléchargée sur son téléphone portable.
L'enquête avait permis d'identifier les cerveaux présumés de l'entreprise de chantage, Mustapha Zouaoui et Axel Angot, qui gravitent depuis des années autour des footballeurs, ainsi que le corbeau présumé, Younès Houass.
Zouaoui et Angot s'étaient ensuite tournés vers Karim Zenati, un ami d'enfance de Benzema, afin que l'attaquant du Real Madrid pousse Valbuena à payer.
Ils ont été mis en examen pour tentative de chantage ou complicité et participation à une association de malfaiteurs.

Suicides on Wall Street
We may never know how much money was lost (or stolen) this year, but the human toll is starting to add up.
Charles Gasparino
12.31.08 6:01 AM ET
The latest tragedy to come out of the Madoff scandal involves a man named Rene-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet, a money manager who lost more than $1 billion of client money, including much, if not all, of his own family’s fortune. Just days after learning of the massive losses, he sat in his office in Midtown Manhattan and methodically slit both of his wrists with a box cutter, and bled to death.
De la Villehuchet's suicide adds yet another gruesome chapter to the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme. For the past two weeks, I’ve reported about the red flags that were missed by inept regulators who could have uncovered the massive fraud sooner, and saved money for countless victims, as well as evidence that Madoff couldn’t have stolen $50 billion all by himself. Then there is the human side of the story—the charities that lost millions; the wealthy and not so wealthy people who lost everything after they handed Madoff their life savings, because like any good scam artist he spent years earning their trust with lies that he could be trusted. And now a suicide from someone who lost everything.
Since the beginning of the year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen to roughly the same level it was 10 years ago. In other words, Americans are no richer now than they were in 1998.
There will be countless stories, profiles, and books written about the Madoff scandal. It will be billed as the financial crime of the century, which, based on everything I know, is probably true. But it’s also part of a bigger story that broke almost the moment 2008 began, when the financial world as we knew it started to fall apart, and the human devastation that followed. In a span of 12 months, two major securities firms employing tens of thousands of people—Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers—were wiped off the map. Big banks like Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs have survived, but just barely, and not without government handouts. Job losses are everywhere on Wall Street, and most people I speak to predict things will get worse.
The tragedy goes beyond the loss of jobs and wealth, because de la Villehuchet's suicide wasn’t the first human casualty to result from the financial implosion of the past year. I know of at least two other people who have taken their own lives because of the Wall Street meltdown. One was Barry Fox, a former analyst at Bear Stearns. People who knew Barry said work was his life. He was committed and loved his job at Bear, which he’d had since 1999. But in May, just weeks after the company imploded and JPMorgan Chase took over the failed investment bank, Barry was told he was one of several thousand people who would be out of work. Not long after, he went home and threw himself out of the window of his 29th-story apartment.
I didn’t know Barry Fox, but I did know Eric Von der Porten, who was a managing partner at Leeward Investments, a small and for a time successful hedge fund in Northern California. I ran into Eric because he was one of the first financial types who saw the hype in the dot-com market in the late 1990s and began questioning the research calls of analysts like Henry Blodget. He wrote to regulators demanding that they crack down on what he thought were fraudulent stock ratings. Stock analysts, he said, were publishing positive ratings only to help their firms win lucrative underwriting contracts from the very same companies they were rating.
Eric was talented and smart; what I loved about him was that he also had a sense of outrage. The story of biased stock ratings was bigger than a bunch of Wall Street types ripping each other off, he believed; these biased ratings were used by brokerage firms like Merrill and Citigroup’s Salomon Smith Barney unit to lure small investors into buying crappy Internet and telecom stocks. Eric also seemed to have his priorities straight. Unlike most people I know in the financial business, Eric gave up jobs at big firms to manage money not far from his hometown so he could dedicate some time to serving on the local school board.
Most recently, Eric, like just about every professional investor I know, lost a lot of money in the markets. He also took his losses particularly hard, and in early December, he suffocated himself to death.
When I took my first economics course 20 years ago, my professor went to great pains to alert the class that the stock market averages make a poor barometer for the economy’s health. Well, those days are long gone; today most people save through their 401(k) plans and are heavily invested in the markets. Since the beginning of the year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen around 5,000 points, to roughly the same level it was 10 years ago. In other words, Americans are no richer now than they were in 1998.
Smart people I know compare our current problems to those facing the nation after the crash of 1929. Financial ruin often pushes people to the brink; we’ve all heard of the suicides that occurred during the ’29 crash, when stockbrokers, after losing all their money in the market, flung themselves out of windows.
I don’t know all the demons that chased Barry Fox and Eric Von der Porton, or Rene-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet, for that matter. In the case of de la Villehuchet, published reports suggest he went into deep despair when he realized that the man he trusted so much, Bernie Madoff, had stolen all his money and there was no way to get it back. In the cases of Barry and Eric, I do know that while they were highly functional people, some who know them say they both suffered from bouts of mental illness.
Still, these same people also tell me that the market upheaval and its personal impact played a critical role in enhancing their despair. The way things are going, I’m afraid there will be many more such incidents in the future.
I make my living writing and reporting about finance, the markets, and the people who work in them, so the last thing I’m going to do is suggest that they aren’t important. They are. Evaporating 10 years' worth of investment gains is serious stuff, and it’s something the new president must immediately address (read my lips: no new taxes!) The big players on Wall Street, people like Warren Buffett, Robert Rubin, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack, and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, are all smart, important men who run companies that are vital to our national economy.
But these people and the companies they control and the markets themselves didn’t deserve the reverence they’ve all been given over the past two decades, as we’re now discovering. By deifying those who don’t deserve it—never deserved it—we made their fall all the more tragic for them, and for us. Which brings me to something important that my friend and CNBC colleague, Larry Kudlow, recently told me during a recent segment. You probably won’t find a person who believes in the power of the markets and free-market capitalism more than Larry Kudlow. But Larry, upon hearing of the tragedies of Barry Fox, Eric Von der Porten, and Rene-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet, went back to the time when he was at his lowest: He was battling drug and alcohol addictions, he was broke, and his marriage was on the rocks.
But he recovered through his faith in God, and because he realized that “it’s only money and money cannot be that important,” and that losing it “is not the end of the world, for heaven's sake. You’ve got families, and we all make mistakes.”

17,"Discussion centers on dangerous animals in Willmar's city limits
By David Little on Oct 17, 2013  at 11:09 p.m.
WILLMAR — A proposed ordinance would establish a process and procedure necessary to declare an animal as potentially dangerous or as a dangerous animal and would define the city’s animal control authority as the Willmar Police Department.
Police Chief David Wyffels explained the need for the ordinance to the City Council’s Public Works/Safety Committee and the committee voted Tuesday evening to recommend the council introduce and set a date for a hearing on the ordinance. The council meets again Monday.
Wyffels said the department has cited a citizen whose dog has bitten three people and killed a small dog in Willmar during nearly the past 12 months.
According to Wyffels, there are no mechanisms in the current animal ordinance to establish the process and procedure necessary to declare an animal as potentially dangerous or as a dangerous animal and the ordinance does not define the animal control authority.
Wyffels said these deficiencies prevent the Police Department, the city prosecutor and district court from taking the action necessary to protect the public from animals that would otherwise be deemed to be potentially dangerous or dangerous under state law.
City Prosecutor Tom Anderson said the proposed ordinance will provide due process that will allow an animal owner cited by the Police Department to present evidence at a hearing and challenge the classification that their animal is dangerous.
If the City Council ultimately rules that the animal is dangerous, the Police Department can confiscate the animal for destruction.
Under the current ordinance, the only solution is to fine the owner but the city is not authorized to confiscate the animal.
The ordinance defines the animal control authority, which means the municipal agency that is responsible for animal control operations in the city.
The ordinance defines a dangerous animal as an animal that has killed a domestic animal without provocation while off the owner’s property; has bitten one or more persons on two or more occasions; and caused substantial bodily harm to any person on public or private property.
In other business, the committee voted to recommend the council approve a construction and maintenance agreement with the BNSF Railway for the new Willmar Avenue Southwest crossing.
The council previously approved a $15,000 easement payment to BNSF that will allow the crossing to be built. In addition, BNSF requires a $2,000 payment for administrative costs, said Bruce Peterson, planning and development director and acting public works director.
Peterson said the agreement allows the city to build up to the crossing; BNSF will build the crossing at the tracks. Peterson said the railroad will build the crossing this year but not the signals."

* Angry investors gather at headquarters
* Collapse puts pressure on market
* Were red flags ignored?  (Adds quote from other investor, announcement that Madoff Securities trades to be cleared)
By Jon Stempel and Christian Plumb
NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Investors scrambled to assess potential losses from an alleged $50 billion fraud by Bernard Madoff, a day after the arrest of the prominent Wall Street trader.
Prosecutors and regulators accused the 70-year-old former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market of masterminding a Ponzi scheme of epic proportions through his investment advisory business, which managed at least one hedge fund. Hundreds of people, investing with him through the firm's clients, entrusted Madoff with billions of dollars, industry experts said.
""Madoff's investors included captains of industry, corporations -- some of which are publicly traded -- that used Madoff almost as a high-yielding cash management account, endowments, universities, foundations and, importantly, many high-profile funds of funds,"" said Douglas Kass, who heads hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management.
""It appears that at least $15 billion of wealth, much of which was concentrated in Southern Florida and New York City, has gone to 'money heaven,'"" he said.
A Ponzi scheme is an illegal investment vehicle that pays off old investors with money from new ones, and is dependent on a constant stream of new investment. Because the invested capital is not earning a sufficient return on its own, such schemes eventually collapse under their own weight.
Federal agents arrested Madoff at his apartment on Thursday after prosecutors said he told senior employees that his money management operations were ""all just one big lie"" and ""basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.""
Madoff is the founder of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, a market-making firm he launched in 1960. His separate investment advisory business had $17.1 billion of assets under management.
'BUSINESS AS USUAL?'
About a dozen angry investors gathered on Friday in the lobby of the Lipstick Building in midtown Manhattan, where the market-making firm and advisory business are headquartered, demanding to know the fate of their money.
One woman said that when she called the firm's offices on Thursday she was told it was ""business as usual.""
Another investor groused, ""Business as usual? Of course it's business as usual. We're getting screwed left and right.""
Police later evicted the small group from the building.
Individual investors were feeling the squeeze elsewhere.
""I expect to get back zero,"" said Susan Leavitt in Tampa Bay, Florida, who invested through Madoff. ""When he tells the Feds, he has $200 million to $300 million left out of billions, what can you expect."" [ID:nN12277760]
The two most prominent hedge funds that invested with Madoff were the $7.3 billion Fairfield Sentry Ltd, run by Walter Noel's Fairfield Greenwich Group, and the $2.8 billion Kingate Global Fund Ltd, run by Kingate Management Ltd.
Fairfield Sentry and Kingate Global were among a small group of hedge funds to report positive returns for 2008; the average hedge fund was down 18 percent, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.
""People who came to us for portfolio construction were often already invested with Bernie Madoff, he had hundreds of clients,"" said Charles Gradante, who invests in hedge funds as a principal at Hennessee Group LLC. ""Now his whole legacy is destroyed. He was God to people.""
Prior to Madoff's arrest, investors had wondered how he was able to generate annual returns in the low double digits in a variety of market environments. Many questioned how U.S. regulators were able to ignore numerous red flags with regards to Madoff's operations.
""Many of us questioned how that strategy could generate those kinds of returns so consistently,"" said Jon Najarian, an options trader who knows Madoff and is a co-founder of optionmonster.com.
In May 2001, Barron's reported that option strategists for major investment banks said they could not understand how Madoff managed to generate the returns that he did.
""We weren't comfortable with Madoff,"" said Brad Alford, president at investment adviser Alpha Capital in Atlanta. ""We didn't understand how his strategy could generate the kind of returns it did. We will walk away from things like that.""
MORE TO COME?
U.S. stocks tumbled in early trading on Friday, with some investors citing the Madoff case as well as the failure of talks in Congress on a rescue for the U.S. auto industry. The market later rebounded, with the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rising 64.59 points, or 0.75 percent, to end unofficially at 8,629.68.
Investors overseas were reeling from the alleged fraud.
Benedict Hentsch, a Swiss private bank, said it had 56 million Swiss francs ($47 million) of exposure to Madoff's investment advisory business. UniCredit SpA's (CRDI.MI) fund management unit, Pioneer Investments, has exposure through its Primeo Select hedge fund, two people familiar with the matter said.
Bramdean Alternatives Ltd BRAL.L said almost 10 percent of its holdings were exposed to Madoff, sending shares in the UK asset manager crashing. [ID:nLC388130]
CNBC Television reported that Sterling Equities, which owns the New York Mets baseball team, had accounts managed by Madoff.
'UNFORTUNATE SET OF EVENTS'
Madoff said ""there is no innocent explanation"" for his activities, and that he ""paid investors with money that wasn't there,"" according to the federal complaint.
Prosecutors also accused Madoff of wanting to distribute as much as $300 million to employees, family members and friends before turning himself in.
Charged with one count of securities fraud, he faces up to 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed separate civil charges.
A hearing had been scheduled for Friday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on the SEC's request to grant powers to the court-appointed receiver to oversee the entire firm, as well as on the commission's request for a firmwide asset freeze.
But the hearing was canceled after the matter was resolved, said a deputy for U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton. No other details were immediately available. The receiver, lawyer Lee Richards, had been appointed by the judge on Thursday to oversee assets and accounts of the firm held abroad.
Madoff's lawyer, Dan Horwitz, said on Thursday, ""We will fight to get through this unfortunate set of events."" His client was released on $10 million bond.
Madoff is a member of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc's (NDAQ.O) nominating committee. His firm has said it is a market-maker for about 350 Nasdaq stocks.
He is also chairman of London-based Madoff Securities International Ltd, whose chief executive, Stephen Raven, said the firm was ""not in any way part of"" the New York-based market-maker.
All equity trades involving the market-making firm will be processed as usual, the Depository Trust Clearing Corp told Reuters on Friday.

8:14PM GMT 14 Dec 2008
As they swapped investment stories at the golf course in Palm Beach, Bernard Madoff's delighted clients sometimes joked that if he was a fraud, he'd take down half the world with him.
In this, at least, they were perceptive. The fallout from the news that the celebrated Wall Street investor was behind an alleged $50 billion (£32.7 billion) swindle – a ""Ponzi"" scheme in which he paid early investors with the money put in by later ones – has swept through the worlds of international business, moneyed society and philanthropy. Potentially thousands of investors, including hedge funds, banks and wealthy individuals, have had huge sums wiped out at a stroke in what could be the biggest fraud in Wall Street history.
A Jewish charity in Boston has shut down and sacked its staff, a group of hedge funds in Connecticut has said it is closing (""I'm wiped out"", said its chairman simply) and banks as far afield as Paris, Zurich and Tokyo are anxiously calculating the cost of their exposure to Bernie Madoff. Geneva-based banks and investment funds alone are estimated to have lost more than £2.5 billion. Even Nicola Horlick, the so-called ""superwoman"" of the City of London, has been hit, her Bramdean Investment firm reportedly investing nearly £21 million with Mr Madoff. Like others, she could only splutter her fury over the weekend at the ""systemic failure"" of US regulators in letting him get away with it for years.
She may have a point. It appears that Mr Madoff's Manhattan-based investment advisory business was never inspected by regulators after he subjected it to oversight two years ago. Mr Madoff, 70, was a generous political donor and had advised the Securities and Exchange Commission how to regulate markets. According to Bloomberg News, for whatever reason, the SEC hadn't examined his books since he registered the unit in September 2006.
A dozen SEC inspectors are now poring over his records, trying to find out what went wrong. There are plenty of theories around already but the bottom line is that Mr Madoff fooled a lot of people who should have known better. Supposedly ""sophisticated investors"" included Fred Wilpon, the main owner of the New York Mets baseball team; Norman Braman, a big Florida car dealer who once owned the Philadelphia Eagles American football club and Ezra Merkin, the chairman of General Motors' financing arm. Carl Shapiro, a Boston philanthropist and former women's clothing magnate, has lost at least $145 million (£95 million), it was reported yesterday. The alleged fraud had ""swept up some of the most prominent and wealthy Americans, along with many people who thought they were embarking on a comfortable retirement and have now been left destitute,"" said Brad Friedman, a lawyer involved in representing more than 30 investors with losses they believe could total more than $1 billion (£655 million).

Madoff's hedge fund 'fraud': Are you affected?
15 Dec 2008
The big names, it appears, would have been among an A-list of investors that Mr Madoff used as a marketing tool to pull in others. He hired unofficial agents and fostered an aura of exclusivity by targeting wealthy country clubs across the US with ""invitation only"" policies. Refusing to take some people on as investors only added to his appeal – Barbara Fox, president of a Manhattan estate agency, told the New York Times she ""literally begged him"" to take her on but he turned her down.
At lunch or on the links, members would talk of him in hushed, admiring tones – Magic Mr Madoff and his Amazing 10 per cent Returns, even in a bear market. In clubs such as the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida and the Old Oaks in Purchase, New York, some called him ""the Jewish bond"" because his fund always managed to pay eight to 12 per cent every year. He also had unofficial agents – friends and colleagues – helping him link up with the wealthy of Dallas, Chicago, Boston and Minneapolis. In Minneapolis, investors from two country clubs alone are thought to have sunk $100 million (£65 million) into his operation.
Even his agents invested heavily. Richard Spring, a former securities analyst from Boca Raton, told the Wall Street Journal he had about $11 million (£7 million) – 95 per cent of his net worth – invested with Mr Madoff. ""That's how much I believed in him,"" he said. Mr Madoff never wanted people to give him too much money straight away. ""Bernie would tell me, 'Let them start small, and if they're happy the first year or two, they can put it more,' ""he said.
It helped enormously that many of these individual investors were just like Mr Madoff – rich, elderly Jewish New Yorkers who divided their time between the city and Florida. It helped, too, that he and his wife, Ruth, were well-liked on that social circuit. Keen golfers, Mr Madoff belonged to half a dozen clubs and were known as a friendly, an understated couple who were not interested in social climbing. Perhaps they felt they didn't need to – the Madoffs have at least three homes including a $9 million (£5.8 million) duplex apartment close to Central Park on Manhattan's Upper East Side, another in Roslyn, New York, and a beachfront house in Montauk, Long Island. There may still be a yacht moored somewhere down in the Bahamas. He has a 55-ft fishing boat called Bull on which he loved to take friends and staff.
Mr Madoff, a native New Yorker who went into finance aged 22 with $5,000 (£3,200) raised from a summer job as a beach lifeguard, was a prominent and generous member of the city's Jewish community. He set up a charitable foundation and was a pillar, too, of Wall Street, where he became chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange.
There was, as countless hapless investors have testified, little about him to arouse suspicion and so much to inspire trust. The lucky few who were allowed to invest with him believed they were being let in on a big secret – which was half right. The secret was that there was no Midas touch to the Madoff investment strategy. His magic, according to the prosecution line, was more that of the Wizard of Oz – pull back the curtain and you would find a little man in a tiny office above his legitimate, art-laden investment firm where there was no computer but a lot of chits written down on pieces of paper.
Ponzi schemes – named after a notorious 1920s American fraudster – can only last as long as there is enough new investment to pay investors who want to withdraw their funds from the scheme. From what prosecutors say Mr Madoff told colleagues, his grip on the operation finally came loose earlier this month when investors asked to redeem $7 billion (£4.6 billion) and he struggled to find it.
Prosecutors have yet to say where all the money went and how much, if any, is left – Did he spend it? Did he lose it on the markets? Is it under his bed? Anything seems possible in this case. Nor will they spell out exactly how long it lasted although they have said it was years and some have speculated that it may have been decades. However, it certainly unravelled fast.
His arrest at 8.30am last Thursday by two FBI agents who turned up at his Manhattan apartment came just hours after he had come clean about everything to his sons, Andrew and Mark, said one of their lawyers. Mark, 42, ran the proprietary trading business and Andrew, 40, was one of its directors. Their lawyers insist that neither, who had worked their lives in the family business, had any knowledge of what their father was doing.
According to prosecutors, he had told two staff – understood to be his sons – that he was ""finished"", that his business was ""just one big lie"" and ""basically, a giant Ponzi scheme"" that had been insolvent for years.
Charged with a single count of securities fraud, as well as a separate civil fraud lawsuit, he has been freed on $10 million (£6.5 million) bail.
As the blame game deepens over responsibility for the mess, it has emerged that Mr Madoff has weathered several investigations. In 1992, he faced regulatory scrutiny after the SEC sued two Florida accountants for allegedly raising $441 million (£288 million) while selling unregistered securities. The SEC determined that the money had been accounted for and didn't accuse Mr Madoff of wrongdoing.
And his uncanny ability to give a steady 10 per cent or so return to investors had raised eyebrows at least once before. But hedge fund managers never like to discuss their strategies and Mr Madoff's reticence – ""It's a proprietary strategy. I can't go into it in great deal"", he said seven years ago – was never seen as that unusual.

21,"LET THERE BE LIGHT: Decision ends suffering

A WODONGA disability worker says he has found light in the darkness after the Victorian Premier announced the criminal records of men convicted of gay sex would be erased.
LET THERE BE LIGHT: Decision ends suffering
Tom Anderson is a relieved man following the Victorian government’s announcement yesterday.

A WODONGA disability worker says he has found light in the darkness after the Victorian Premier announced yesterday the criminal records of men convicted of gay sex would be erased.
At 14, Tom Anderson, now 51, was the victim of a sexual predator more than twice his age, four years before laws against male homosexuality were abolished in 1981.
Instead of being protected by the authorities he turned to for help, police charged Mr Anderson with sodomy.
He had to apologise to the court for having gay sex and he was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond.
The change he had been waiting almost a lifetime for came yesterday, with Premier Denis Napthine announcing his government would be the first in the country to legislate to expunge historical convictions of homosexuality.
“I feel as though a light has been turned on in the darkness of my past,” Mr Anderson said.
“It has been a part of me, it’s been locked in my psyche forever, it has been a weight around my neck.”
Human Rights Law Centre lawyer Anna Brown, who represents Mr Anderson, said change has come because of people like him.
“I think Tom’s story and the stories of people like Noel Tovey (a Melbourne author who has campaigned for the changes) means when we talk to politicians and people in power that the power of the story has an incredible impact and has been a key factor in changing hearts and minds within the Coalition government,” Ms Brown said.
Mr Anderson was a paperboy when his boss at the Melbourne newstand where he worked started to groom him.
He was abused for three months until Mr Anderson told his mother, who took him straight to police.
The 40-something aged boss pleaded guilty to charges of sexual abuse before Mr Anderson’s admissions to police led to the charges against the teenager.
“They turned me from a victim into a criminal,” Mr Anderson said.
Three years ago, and three months after his mother’s death, Mr Anderson sent out a single tweet on the social networking site that read “I have a secret I have kept for 34 years”.
It sparked his involvement in a growing call from men across the state to overturn their convictions.
Mr Anderson was contacted by The Border Mail and he shared his story while sitting at the same table he did yesterday at a Wodonga cafe.
“My mother always said to me, ‘please wait until the time was right’. She wasn’t well towards the end of her life. I don’t know that it was she didn’t want the embarrassment, I just don’t think she wanted the stress,” he said.
“I said a little prayer last night, had a little conversation with my mother and said ‘we were all right. It’s over.’”
He said his mother would feel relief.
“She hated herself for letting it happen. She also hated as I got older, when I turned 40, she told me she hated herself for not having me get counselling back then,” he said.
Dr Napthine, who made the announcement at the opening of Melbourne gay and lesbian festival Midsumma, said it was now accepted that consensual sexual acts between two adult men should never have been a crime.
“We also recognise the social and psychological impacts that have been experienced by those who have historical convictions for acts which should no longer be a crime under today’s law,” he said.
“These convictions have been allowed to stand for far too long, which is why we will legislate to rectify this situation.”
Attorney-General Robert Clark said the reforms would come into place in 2015 with those effected having to apply to have their convictions overturned.
Mr Anderson said the Human Rights Law Centre would make an application on his behalf.
The centre represents three men, but Ms Brown said there could be hundreds affected by the law who have never come forward.
“Our hope is people will start to feel comfortable about coming forward now the government said they will act,” Ms Brown said.
Mr Anderson is now calling for an apology.
“That’s what I’m holding on for,” he said, and his face hardened as he fought tears.
“I want them to say ‘sorry, we got it wrong, the system that you went to to protect you let you down’.”

22,"Dan Goodman, Grand Forks, letter: Congress mustn't end run Constitution
By Dan Goodman on Mar 16, 2010  at 11:00 p.m.
GRAND FORKS -- Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., left out some very significant information (""Reconciliation has vital but limited role,"" Page A4, March 8).
He correctly refers to reconciliation as a process that's been used before, but he leaves out the fact that's it's never been used for anything of this magnitude or in this manner.
Conrad also refers to the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 as abuses of the process. If tax cuts and giving people back more of their money are abuses, that's kind of abuse I can take. And let's not forget that these tax cuts brought us higher federal tax revenues, strong job growth and decreasing deficits in President George W. Bush's second term, trends that continued until Democrats gained control of Congress in 2007.
But my biggest concern is the end run Conrad and his colleagues are trying to perpetrate on the American people, in the congressmens' attempt to push what they call reform, but a big majority of voters see as a huge expansion of high-cost entitlements.
If the Democrats continue to circumvent the Senate and House rules and process, they will make Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme look like a Boy Scout. And before you say I'm against health care for everybody: I'm all for responsible health care, which this does not qualify as.
One final point: To me, ""budget neutral"" does not mean rifling $400 billion to $500 billion from an already stressed Medicare system, nor does it mean charging taxpayers for 10 years for six or seven years of benefits. That sounds like fuzzy math to me.
Reform health care by all means, but do it in a responsible manner -- and remember who you work for: your constituents, the taxpayers.
Memo to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: I'd kind of like to see the bill for a period of time before the House votes on it; because first, I don't trust you, and second, that is what President Barack Obama promised.

RBS and HSBC among major banks to admit losses from $50bn Wall Street fraud
Andrew Clark in New York
Tuesday 16 December 2008 00.01 GMT
First published on Tuesday 16 December 2008 00.01 GMT
From Hollywood to Tokyo, London and Jerusalem, furious victims are demanding answers. How could a 70-year-old man on the 17th floor of a Manhattan tower block fiddle the global financial community out of $50bn?
Yesterday the sheer scale of the deceit perpetrated by Bernie Madoff was only gradually becoming clear. The genial, white-haired Wall Street figure has emerged as one of the biggest alleged financial fraudsters in history, with victims ranging from some of the world's biggest banks to individual investors who have seen their life savings wiped out.
HSBC yesterday said it had exposure of about $1bn, while Royal Bank of Scotland is staring at a possible loss of £400m.
A children's charity run by the film director Steven Spielberg invested as much as 60% of its money with Madoff. Hundreds of prominent members of Jewish communities in New York and Florida entrusted Madoff with their savings. Even the high-flying City fund manager Nicola Horlick, once dubbed ""superwoman"", has been caught out in the £33.5bn scam.
""This has made law enforcement and regulatory agencies in the US look absolutely ridiculous,"" said Bradley Simon, a New York defence lawyer specialising in white-collar crime. ""How they failed to spot this is beyond me. It's incomprehensible that they couldn't somehow have got wind of it.""
Madoff's inner sanctum was a suite of offices in a New York tower known as the Lipstick Building for its distinctive shape. While a seemingly legitimate stockbroking business operated from the 18th and 19th floor, Madoff reserved the 17th floor for himself and a small group of employees.
A former chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange with a privileged lifestyle as a member of elite clubs in New York and Florida, he built up a reputation as an old-school banker. His company website spoke of a personal touch that ""harks back to an earlier era in the financial world"".
But Madoff kept his fund management business closely under wraps - even his sons, Mark and Andrew, who were senior figures at the company, appear to have been in the dark. Their father was holed up at his $9m penthouse on New York's Upper East Side yesterday.
Madoff is thought to have used deposits from new clients to pay off established customers. ""He lost control of the situation and became desperate,"" says Simon. ""He was borrowing from Peter to pay Paul.""
Madoff reportedly confessed to his sons last week that his investment management business was ""all just one big lie"". He admitted his firm was nothing but a gigantic pyramid scheme with no capital at its core.
The son of a Jewish family from the New York borough of Queens, he set up his firm with money saved from a job as a beach lifeguard. For years, he delighted investors by delivering a return of 10% to 12% every year. There were a few whiffs of something amiss. Last year, one hedge fund advisory firm, Aksia, told its clients to steer clear of Madoff, pointing out that his books were audited by an obscure accountancy firm called Friehling & Horowitz. The firm, now under investigation by a New York district attorney, comprises three people of whom one is a secretary and another a 70-year-old partner living in Florida.
Responding to complaints, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) looked into Madoff's accounts in 2005 and 2007, finding a handful of minor transgressions the first time.
Horlick, whose firm Bramdean Asset Management had 9% of its assets invested with Madoff, told the BBC US regulators could no longer be trusted. ""I think now it is very difficult for people to invest in things that are meant to be regulated in America, because they have fallen down on the job,"" she said.
Big names snared by Madoff's scheme include the billionaire US newspaper magnate Mort Zuckerman and the owner of the New York Mets baseball team, Fred Wilpon. But many of Madoff's victims are smaller scale savers, often introduced to the financier at upscale golf clubs in Long Island or Florida's Palm Beach.
Ross Intelisano, of law firm Rich & Intelisano said many people had lost their savings: ""This is a rare case in which a lot of investors we've spoken to had all their money with this one firm. They might have thought they were worth $25m one week and now they're worth nothing.""
Scores of Jewish organisations have been caught up in the mess. A Massachusetts charity which funded trips to Israel for children, the Robert Lappin Foundation, closed its doors over the weekend because of losses incurred with Madoff.
If Madoff's estimate of a $50bn black hole proves accurate, his fraud far exceeds the deficit run up by rogue traders such as Nick Leeson or Jerome Kerviel. .
A conviction could condemn the 70-year-old to jail for the rest of his life.
Laura Unger, a former SEC commissioner, said Madoff: ""Our regulatory structure is just so broke it's ridiculous. The market is so much more complex and fast-moving than the regulatory system allows for,"" she said.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bernard Madoff has single-handedly turned an already very bad year for hedge funds into a catastrophe.
Now the industry's already steep losses may grow even larger, dozens of funds might collapse and confidence eroded even more after a 70-year old New York-based investor allegedly cheated investors from Palm Beach, to New York, to Geneva to Madrid out of as much as $50 billion (33 billion pounds).
""You already have a crisis of confidence because of the falling stock market,"" said Charles Gradante, who selects hedge funds for clients as a co-founder of the Hennessee Group.
""Now that crisis has broadened to hedge funds directly because Bernie Madoff seems to have pulled off a gigantic fraud for so many years.""
Panicked hedge fund investors hearing tales of how Madoff cheated his clients might worry they cannot trust their own managers either, investors and industry lawyers said.
""If this had happened any earlier in the year, you would have seen even more people trying to run for the exits,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisor.
The $1.5 trillion industry has been flooded with redemption notices for months as investors react to the industry's deepest ever losses of 18 percent.
Indeed, the panic will likely spread into next year.
""Anyone on the fence regarding redemptions to the fund industry over the next several months will likely put in their requests for capital withdrawal, as confidence in the system and in investment managers has been irreparably impaired,"" said Doug Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management.
For years Madoff played the part of a solid investment manager by boasting on his website about the firm's ""unblemished record of value, fair-dealing and high ethical standards.""
His office was filled with computer banks, there was little paper and he reflected the industry's reputation for secrecy by telling would-be investors very little about how he worked, people who know him remembered.
""Madoff's outfit was such a black box,"" said Salomon Konig, who helps endowments and wealthy families select hedge funds as chief investment officer at Artemis Capital Partners.
Konig was so worried that he told funds of hedge funds he was not interested in doing business with them if they were involved with with Madoff, a society lion known for his affable manner at charity functions.
But plenty of other investors were less careful and downright eager to invest with Madoff, whose records showed he lost money in only five of 156 months, several people familiar with his clientele said.
Tremont Capital was an early fan, the people said. Also hedge funds Fairfield Sentry, run by Walter Noel, and Kingate Global Fund, were known as feeder funds for Madoff. And Spanish group BBVA had offered U.S. based advisors a chance to put their clients' money in his hands.
As the list of people linked with Madoff grows, industry experts believe the pain will be felt far and wide.
""This will be a who's who of people caught with him,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors.
Already rumors are swirling about funds that will be wiped out by the alleged fraud.
""Is this going to be the nail in the coffin for a few hedge funds already teetering on the edge, I absolutely think so,"" said Peter Turecek, a managing director at Kroll Inc, a risk consultancy owned by Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc.
Another major result from the Madoff case will be an increase in hedge fund surveillance.
""A lot of people treat due diligence as a check the box kind of endeavor and this is a poster-child case for why you need to do real due diligence,"" Turecek added.

Crazy Like A Fox
Six months ago, any investor who turned down the chance to put their money with Bernie Madoff would have been considered crazy. Now the Daily News gossip column is reporting that Madoff may be employing an insanity defense as his excuse for running a roughly $50 Ponzi scheme that has bankrupted investors and charities around the world. “Bernie’s family and his attorneys may argue that, somewhere along the line, he had a mental break,” says a Madoff acquaintance. “They may even say he has a multiple personality disorder.” Madoff's mental state is hard to determine, as his family is doing most of his talking, but he is said to be on high doses of anti-anxiety medication. Top criminal attorney Edward Hayes an insanity defense is Madoff's best bet. “Madoff admitted to his sons that he knew it was a Ponzi scheme. His best defense is making himself essential to discovering where the money is and getting it to the victims.”"
26,"Two month farm standoff continues southeast of Lakota
By Steve Lee on Oct 6, 2011  at 9:36 p.m.
1 / 5
4 / 5
5 / 5
The standoff continues between Nelson County Sheriff Kelly Janke's department and a rural Lakota, N.D.,  family that has  holed up in their farmstead the past two months, refusing to respond to felony warrants stemming from a dispute this summer over a neighbor's cattle.
Janke said Thursday he continues to try to make contact with Rodney Brossart, who with his wife, Susan, and seven of their children, has resisted efforts to get Brossart and four of his children to face felony charges.
Despite rumors late Thursday by neighbors of Rodney Brossart -- who lives with his wife and seven of their children on a farm southeast of Lakota, N.D. -- of sightings of lots of law enforcement vehicles Thursday night, that was a separate case, Janke said.
""We are dealing with a suicidal person barricaded in,"" Janke said late in the night. ""We are still negotiating.""
The Grand Forks regional SWAT team was deployed to Nelson County to assist with the person who was barricaded in and suicidal.
Meanwhile and separately, Janke said he's still working to reach Brossart in the unusual case of warrants making five of the family subject to arrest on sight. But because Brossart's sons have brandished rifles at deputies before, Janke is taking a careful approach.
Rodney and Susan Brossart, and seven of their children -- four of whom face felony charges --  have been staying close to the farm yard, not going far enough out to harvest their soybeans which are ripening, Janke said Thursday afternoon.
An older son lives in a nearby town and said Thursday he is not involved in the dispute.  But Rodney Brossart's widowed mother, who lives in Lakota, has been ferrying food and other supplies out to the farm, Janke said. The family otherwise has fended off any attempts to talk.
Neighbors are concerned and were hoping a resolution was coming Thursday night.
Tom Anderson, the neighbor whose three cows with three calves allegedly were taken by the Brossarts in June, sparking the standoff, drove by the Brossart place this evening. ""Not a light on at the place,"" he said. The Brossarts have kept their three-yard lights turned off in recent weeks. ""It's almost spooky,"" Anderson said.
And the court case isn't going away.
On Thursday, Rodney and his adult children, Alex, Thomas, Jacob and Abby -- who, like him, face felony charges from incidents this summer -- were assigned case numbers by the state district court in Lakota, and each filed a ""letter from defendant to court, with attachments"" -- according to state district court records.
The content of any of these letters was not available online from the state's court website. Susan Brossart faces a misdemeanor charge of lying to law enforcement about the situation at one point in the ongoing dispute.
Three of Brossarts' younger children are home-schooled and apparently remain with the family, not leaving the place, according to neighbors who asked that their names not be published.
The strange standoff stems from a reported theft in June by Rodney Brossart, 55, of six cattle belonging to a Anderson and his son, Christopher Anderson. The three cows with calves were outside the fence, straying, but evidence shows the Brossarts drove the animals into Brossart's farm yard and then refused to return them, Anderson said.
Brossart has increasingly feuded with local government officials over road maintenance in recent years, and feuded with neighbors enough so several who were interviewed have asked that their names not be published.
Since the June dispute, Tom Anderson said he keeps a rifle handy in his tractor cab and pickup truck while he's working in the fields.
""Those three boys are crazy. I'm not going to be out there without (the rifle.)"" It's a story of a conflict that escalated in serious charges carrying serious prison time for anyone convicted.
On June 23, Rodney resisted deputies who first came to check about the report of stolen cattle. He was Tasered, subdued and handcuffed. While scuffling with deputies, Rodney allegedly yelled at his son to get a long gun from a nearby pickup truck. Once inside a squad car, Rodney caused $1,000 in damage to it, according to the court complaint. His daughter, Abby, hit deputies during the arrest and was arrested, too.
But Sheriff Janke said early Thursday afternoon he was working patiently to avoid any violence.
""We continue to try to contact them, so we can resolve this peacefully,"" he said Thursday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors scrambled to assess potential losses from an alleged $50 billion fraud by Bernard Madoff, a day after the arrest of the prominent Wall Street trader.
Prosecutors and regulators accused the 70-year-old, who was chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market in the early 1990s, of masterminding a fraud of epic proportions through his investment advisory business, which managed at least one hedge fund.
Hundreds of people, investing with him through the firm's clients, entrusted Madoff with billions of dollars, industry experts said.
""Madoff's investors included captains of industry, corporations -- some of which are publicly traded -- that used Madoff almost as a high-yielding cash management account, endowments, universities, foundations and, importantly, many high-profile funds of funds,"" said Douglas Kass, who heads hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management.
""It appears that at least $15 billion of wealth, much of which was concentrated in southern Florida and New York City, has gone to 'money heaven,'"" he said.
For a list of companies exposed to Madoff's alleged fraud, please see:
Federal agents arrested Madoff at his apartment on Thursday after prosecutors said he told senior employees that his money management operations were ""all just one big lie"" and ""basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.""
A Ponzi scheme is an illegal investment vehicle that pays off old investors with money from new ones, and is dependent on a constant stream of new investment. Because the invested capital is not earning a sufficient return on its own, such schemes eventually collapse under their own weight.
Madoff is the founder of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, a market-making firm he launched in 1960. His separate investment advisory business had $17.1 billion of assets under management.
'BUSINESS AS USUAL?'
About a dozen angry investors gathered on Friday in the lobby of the Lipstick Building in midtown Manhattan, where the market-making firm and advisory business are headquartered, demanding to know the fate of their money.
One woman said that when she called the firm's offices on Thursday she was told it was ""business as usual.""
Another investor groused, ""Business as usual? Of course it's business as usual. We're getting screwed left and right.""
Police later evicted the small group from the building.
Individual investors were feeling the squeeze elsewhere.
""I expect to get back zero,"" said Floridian Susan Leavitt, who invested through Madoff. ""When he tells the feds he has $200 million to $300 million left out of billions, what can you expect?""
Two law firms, Milberg LLP and Seeger Weiss LLP, said Friday they had been retained by ""dozens of individual investors"" in Madoff Securities.
The two most prominent hedge funds that invested with Madoff were the $7.3 billion Fairfield Sentry Ltd, run by Walter Noel's Fairfield Greenwich Group, and the $2.8 billion Kingate Global Fund Ltd, run by Kingate Management Ltd.
Fairfield Greenwich Group said it was trying to determine the extent of potential losses and vowed to pursue recovery of any lost assets. The firm said it had been working with Madoff for nearly 20 years.
Fairfield Sentry and Kingate Global were among a small group of hedge funds to report positive returns for 2008; the average hedge fund was down 18 percent, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.
""People who came to us for portfolio construction were often already invested with Bernie Madoff. He had hundreds of clients,"" said Charles Gradante, who invests in hedge funds as a principal at Hennessee Group LLC. ""Now his whole legacy is destroyed. He was God to people.""
Prior to Madoff's arrest, investors had wondered how he was able to generate annual returns in the low double digits in a variety of market environments. Many questioned how U.S. regulators were able to ignore numerous red flags with regard to Madoff's operations.
""Many of us questioned how that strategy could generate those kinds of returns so consistently,"" said Jon Najarian, an options trader who knows Madoff and is a co-founder of optionmonster.com.
In May 2001, Barron's reported that option strategists for major investment banks said they could not understand how Madoff managed to generate the returns that he did.
""We weren't comfortable with Madoff,"" said Brad Alford, president at investment adviser Alpha Capital in Atlanta. ""We didn't understand how his strategy could generate the kind of returns it did. We will walk away from things like that.""
MORE TO COME?
U.S. stocks tumbled in early trading on Friday, with some investors citing the Madoff case as well as the failure of talks in Congress on a rescue for the U.S. auto industry. The market later rebounded, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing 0.75 percent higher for the day.
Investors overseas were reeling from the alleged fraud.
Benedict Hentsch, a Swiss private bank, said it had 56 million Swiss francs ($47 million) of exposure to Madoff's investment advisory business.
Italian bank UniCredit SpA's fund management unit, Pioneer Investments, has exposure through its Primeo Select hedge fund, two people familiar with the matter said.
Bramdean Alternatives Ltd said almost 10 percent of its holdings were exposed to Madoff, sending shares in the UK asset manager crashing.
CNBC Television reported that Sterling Equities, which owns the New York Mets baseball team, had accounts managed by Madoff.

Madoff said ""there is no innocent explanation"" for his activities, and that he ""paid investors with money that wasn't there,"" according to the federal complaint.
Prosecutors also accused Madoff of wanting to distribute as much as $300 million to employees, family members and friends before turning himself in.
Charged with one count of securities fraud, he faces up to 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed separate civil charges.
A hearing had been scheduled for Friday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on the SEC's request to grant powers to the court-appointed receiver to oversee the entire firm, as well as on the commission's request for a firmwide asset freeze.
But the hearing was canceled after the matter was resolved, said a deputy for U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton. No other details were immediately available. The receiver, lawyer Lee Richards, had been appointed by the judge on Thursday to oversee assets and accounts of the firm held abroad.
Madoff's lawyer, Dan Horwitz, said on Thursday: ""We will fight to get through this unfortunate set of events."" His client was released on $10 million bond.
Madoff is a member of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc's nominating committee. His firm has said it is a market-maker for about 350 Nasdaq stocks.
He is also chairman of London-based Madoff Securities International Ltd, whose chief executive, Stephen Raven, said the firm was ""not in any way part of"" the New York-based market-maker.
All equity trades involving the market-making firm will be processed as usual, the Depository Trust Clearing Corp told Reuters on Friday.

By the end, the world itself was too small to support the vast Ponzi scheme constructed by Bernard L. Madoff .
Initially, he tapped local money pulled in from country clubs and charity dinners, where investors sought him out to casually plead with him to manage their savings so they could start reaping the steady, solid returns their envied friends were getting.
Then, he and his promoters set sights on Europe, again framing the investments as memberships in a select club. A Swiss hedge fund manager, Michel Dominicé, still remembers the pitch he got a few years ago from a salesman in Geneva. “He told me the fund was closed, that it was something I couldn’t buy,” Mr. Dominicé said. “But he told me he might have a way to get me in. It was weird.”
Mr. Madoff’s agents next cut a cash-gathering swath through the Persian Gulf, then Southeast Asia. Finally, they were hurtling with undignified speed toward China, with invitations to invest that were more desperate, less exclusive. One Beijing businessman who was approached said it seemed the Madoff funds were being pitched “to anyone who would listen.”

The juggernaut began to sputter this fall as investors, rattled by the financial crisis and reaching for cash, started taking money out faster than Mr. Madoff could bring fresh cash in the door. He was arrested on Dec. 11 at his Manhattan apartment and charged with securities fraud, turned in the night before by his sons after he told them his entire business was “a giant Ponzi scheme.”

The case is still viewed more with mystery than clarity, and Mr. Madoff’s version of events can only be drawn from statements attributed to him by federal prosecutors and regulators as he has not commented publicly on the case.
But whatever else Mr. Madoff’s game was, it was certainly this: The first worldwide Ponzi scheme — a fraud that lasted longer, reached wider and cut deeper than any similar scheme in history, entirely eclipsing the puny regional ambitions of Charles Ponzi, the Boston swindler who gave his name to the scheme nearly a century ago.
“Absolutely — there has been nothing like this, nothing that we could call truly global,” said Mitchell Zuckoff, the author of “Ponzi’s Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend” and a professor at Boston University. These classic schemes typically prey on local trust, he added. “So this says what we increasingly know to be true about the world: The barriers have come down; money knows no borders, no limits.”
While many of the known victims of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities are prominent Jewish executives and organizations — Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Spitzers, Yeshiva University, the Elie Wiesel Foundation and charities set up by the publisher Mortimer B. Zuckerman and the Hollywood director Steven Spielberg — it now appears that anyone with money was a potential target. Indeed, at one point, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, a large sovereign wealth fund in the Middle East, had entrusted some $400 million to Mr. Madoff’s firm.
Regulators say Mr. Madoff himself estimated that $50 billion in personal and institutional wealth from around the world was gone. It vanished from the estates of the North Shore of Long Island, from the beachfront suites of Palm Beach, from the exclusive enclaves of Europe. Before it evaporated, it helped finance Mr. Madoff’s coddled lifestyle, with a Manhattan apartment, a beachfront mansion in the Hamptons, a small villa overlooking Cap d’Antibes on the French Riviera, a Mayfair office in London and yachts in New York, Florida and the Mediterranean.
Just as the scheme transcended national borders, it left local regulators far behind. Its lies were translated into a half-dozen languages. Its larceny was denominated in a half-dozen currencies. Its warning signals were missed by enforcement agencies around the globe. And its victims are now scattered from Hollywood to Zurich to Abu Dhabi.
Indeed, while the most visible pain may be local — an important charity forced to close, an esteemed university embarrassed, a fabric of community trust shredded — the clearest lesson is universal: When money goes global, fraud does too.
Bernie Who?
In 1960, as Wall Street was just shaking off its postwar lethargy and starting to buzz again, Bernie Madoff (pronounced MAY-doff) set up his small trading firm. His plan was to make a business out of trading lesser-known over-the-counter stocks on the fringes of the traditional stock market. He was just 22, a graduate of Hofstra University on Long Island.

By 1989, Mr. Madoff ‘s firm was handling more than 5 percent of the trading volume on the august New York Stock Exchange, and Financial World magazine ranked him among the highest-paid people on Wall Street — along with two far more famous financiers, the junk bond king Michael Milken and George Soros, the international investor.
And in 1990, he became the nonexecutive chairman of the Nasdaq market, which at the time was operated as a committee of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
His rise on Wall Street was built on his belief in a visionary notion that seemed bizarre to many at the time: That stocks could be traded by people who never saw each other but were connected only by electronics.
In the mid-1970s, he had spent over $250,000 to upgrade the computer equipment at the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, where he began offering to buy and sell stocks that were listed on the Big Board. The exchange, in effect, was transformed into the first all-electronic computerized stock exchange.
“He was one of the early innovators,” said Michael Ocrant, a journalist who has been a longtime skeptic about Mr. Madoff’s investing success. “He was known to promote the idea that trading would be going electronic — and that turned out to be true.”
He also invested in new electronic trading technology for his firm, making it cheaper for brokerage firms to fill their stock orders. He eventually gained a large amount of business from big firms like A. G. Edwards & Sons, Charles Schwab & Company, Quick & Reilly and Fidelity Brokerage Services. “He was really a low-key guy. No one knew him outside of the sphere of market makers and people in the trading and brokerage business,” said Richard B. Niehoff, who was president of the Cincinnati exchange in the mid-1980s.
Mr. Madoff’s push to modernize trading did not make him popular with the traditional traders on the floor of the New York Exchange, as more of its orders were sent to his firm — partly because he was faster and cheaper, but also because he paid for those orders.
Mr. Madoff pioneered a controversial practice called “payment for order flow.” He would pay big players like Fidelity and Schwab to send their customer orders to his firm instead of to the New York Exchange or other regional exchanges.

The floor traders at those traditional exchanges claimed he was, in essence, paying bribes and that brokers steering business to him were not really getting the best prices for their customers.
Those complaints led to Congressional hearings, but Mr. Madoff made no apologies. He insisted the order-flow payments were necessary to inject greater competition into the marketplace and reduce the near monopoly of the Big Board.
As the debate received more attention, Mr. Madoff became increasingly better known in the financial world. By the end of the technology bubble in 2000, his firm was the largest market maker on the Nasdaq electronic market, and he was a member of the Securities Industry Association, now known as the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street’s principal lobbying arm.
Still, one Wall Street heavyweight who knew him in those days said he remained “a self-effacing kind of guy,” more likely to spend time on the Riviera than at parties with other traders.
Local Hero
Unlike some prominent Wall Street figures who built their fortunes during the heady 1980s and ’90s, Mr. Madoff never became a household name among American investors. But in the clubby world of Jewish philanthropy in the New York area, his increasing wealth and growing reputation among market insiders added polish to his personal prestige.
He became a generous donor, then a courted board member and, finally, the money manager of choice for many prominent regional charities.
A spokeswoman for the New York Community Trust, Ani Hurwitz, recalled a Long Island couple who asked the trust in 1994 to invest their proposed $20 million fund with Mr. Madoff. “We have an investment committee that oversees all investments, and they couldn’t get anything out of him, no information, nothing,” Ms. Hurwitz said. “So we told the donors we wouldn’t do it.”
But many charities did entrust their money to Mr. Madoff, to their eventual grief. The North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, for instance, reported that it had lost $5.7 million on an investment with Mr. Madoff that was made at the donor’s behest. (That donor has pledged to cover the loss for the hospital system, its spokesman said.)

Other groups saw the handsome returns on those initial investments and put more of their money into Mr. Madoff’s firm, their leaders said. “Look, for years we made money,” one said.
Most successful business executives intertwine their personal and professional lives. But those two strands of Mr. Madoff’s life were practically inseparable. He sometimes used his 55-foot fishing boat, Bull, as a floating entertainment center for clients. He used his support of organizations like the Public Theater in  Manhattan and the Special Olympics to build a network of trust that began to stretch wider and deeper into the Jewish community.
Through friends, the Madoff network reached well beyond New York. At Oak Ridge Country Club, in suburban Hopkins, Minn., known for a prosperous Jewish membership, many who belonged were introduced to the Madoff firm by one of his friends, Mike Engler.
The quiet message became familiar in similar pockets of Jewish wealth and trust: “I know Bernie. I can get you in.” Mr. Engler died in 1994, but many Oak Ridge members remained clients of Mr. Madoff. One elderly member, who said he was too embarrassed to be named, said he had lost tens of millions of dollars, and had friends who had been “completely wiped out.”
Dozens of now-outraged Madoff investors recall that special lure — the sense that they were being allowed into an inner circle, one that was not available to just anyone. A lawyer would call a client, saying: “I’m setting up a fund for Bernie Madoff. Do you want in?” Or an accountant at a golf club might tell his partner for the day: “I can make an introduction. Let me know.” Deals were struck in steakhouses and at charity events, sometimes by Mr. Madoff himself, but with increasing frequency by friends acting on his behalf.
“In a social setting — that’s where it always happened,” said Jerry Reisman, a lawyer from Garden City, N.Y., who knew Mr. Madoff socially. “Country clubs, golf courses, locker rooms. Recommendations, word of mouth. That’s how it was done.”

At exclusive retreats like the Palm steakhouse in East Hampton, Mr. Madoff would work the tables or receive friends at his own, building a following that came to include lawyers, doctors, real estate developers and accountants. Tomas Romano, a manager at the Palm, recalled that “people always came to talk with him” at the restaurant. “He was very well known.”
At his golf clubs — the Atlantic in Bridgehampton and the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida, for example — he frequently shot in the 80s, but often seemed far more interested in his fellow members, many of whom became investors, than in the game itself.

With his wife, Ruth, a nutritionist and cookbook editor, they were considered affable and charming people. “They stood out,” Mr. Reisman said. “Success, philanthropy, esteem — and, if you were lucky enough to be with him as an investor, money.”
He added: “That was the most important thing; he was looked on as someone who could make you money. Really make you money.”
The Go-Betweens
By the mid-1990s, as Mr. Madoff’s wealth and social standing grew, he had moved far beyond the days when golf-club buddies were setting up side deals to invest with him through their lawyers and accountants. Some of the most prominent Jewish figures in high finance and industry  began to court Bernie Madoff — and, through them, he reached a new orbit of wealth.
He could not have had a more effective recruiter than Jacob Ezra Merkin, a lion of Wall Street who would be president of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue. Mr. Merkin’s father, Hermann, was the founding president of the synagogue and Herman Wouk, the author, wrote its constitution.
As a direct descendant of the founder of modern Orthodox Judaism and a graduate of Columbia’s English department and Harvard’s law school, Mr. Merkin easily held his own in a congregation that included such luminaries as the author Elie Wiesel, the deal maker Ronald O. Perelman and Ira Rennert, a wealthy financier perhaps best known for building one of the biggest houses and compounds in the Hamptons.
Mr. Merkin was fluent in Jewish and secular studies, as comfortatle quoting Psalms as William James.  In 1985, after a few years of practicing law at a top-tier firm, now known as   Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, he started the investment firm that would become Gabriel Capital Group. He contributed to a popular textbook on investing, lived in an art-filled Park Avenue apartment and continued his family’s legacy of generosity.
Philanthropies embraced him. He headed the investment committee for the UJA-Federation of New York for 10 years and was on the boards of Yeshiva University, Carnegie Hall and other nonprofit organizations. He became the chairman of GMAC.
Installed in these lofty positions of trust, Ezra Merkin seemed to be a Wall Street wise man who could be trusted completely to manage other people’s money. One vehicle through which he did that was a fund called Ascot Partners.

It was one of an unknown number of deals that prominent financial figures set up in recent years and marketed to investors, who thought they were tapping into the acumen of some Wall Street titan, like Mr. Merkin.
As it turned out, their money wound up in the same place — in Bernie Madoff’s hands.
These conduits began to steer billions of dollars into the Madoff operation. They operated below the financial radar until Mr. Madoff’s scheme collapsed, when investors suddenly got letters from the sponsoring titan disclosing that all or most of their money was probably gone.
Ascot itself attracted $1.8 billion in investments, almost all of which was entrusted to Mr. Madoff. New York Law School put $3 million into Ascot two years ago, and has now initiated a lawsuit in federal court that accuses Mr. Merkin of abdicating his duties to the partnership.
Mortimer Zuckerman, the billionaire owner of The Daily News, rebuked Ascot in a televised interview, saying he had been misled about what Mr. Merkin had done with some $30 million from Mr. Zuckerman’s charitable foundation.
Behind a wall of lawyers, Mr. Merkin did not take calls this week. In the “Dear Limited Partner” letter he sent on Dec. 11, he noted that he, too, was one of Mr. Madoff’s victims and suffered big losses alongside his investors. He has taken steps to wind down  his  Ascot, Gabriel, and Ariel  funds.
Still, some of his clients are stunned, and angry, to learn what Mr. Merkin did with their millions, while collecting an annual  management fee of 1.5 percent of the assets for his services.
But before the losses and the outraged cries of betrayal, this was a heady way to steer money into an operation that has now been branded, by its own architect, as a Ponzi scheme. And nothing illustrates what a quantum leap it was for Mr. Madoff than the connections that led Tufts University to entrust him with $20 million in 2005.
Tufts did not actually send a check to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. Rather, it invested in Ascot Partners, Mr. Merkin’s partnership. Mr. Merkin had been a major investor in a company whose board included James A. Stern, a member of the Tufts investment committee and a principal in a major private investment firm in New York called the Cypress Group.

Behind these veils of paperwork and partnerships, Mr. Madoff’s reach now extended into the top tiers of Jewish finance and philanthropy, where he rubbed shoulders with corporate directors and prominent hedge fund managers. But there were wider worlds to conquer.

The Circle Grows
Walter M. Noel was the courtly public face of the Fairfield Greenwich Group, the investment firm he started in 1983. A native of Tennessee, Mr. Noel had spent time at larger firms, notably at Chemical Bank, where he headed its international private banking practice, before setting out on his own.
From the beginning, the Noel family was built on access to prestigious social circles. Mr. Noel’s wife, Monica, was part of the prominent Haegler family of Rio de Janeiro and Zurich, and their daughters would marry into international families that provided additional connections for the firm.
In 1989, Mr. Noel merged his business with a small brokerage firm whose general partner was Jeffrey Tucker, a longtime New Yorker who had a law degree from Brooklyn Law School and a résumé that included eight years with the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Again and again, this pedigreed experience was emphasized by Fairfield as it built itself into a fund of funds, investing in other hedge funds. It boasted to its prospects that its investigation of investment options was “deeper and broader” than those of most firms  because of Mr. Tucker’s experience in the regulatory ranks.
Though he is not nearly as prominent as the Noels, who move in the forefront of Connecticut society, Mr. Tucker benefited just as much from Fairfield’s success. Indeed, last year he led a coalition of thoroughbred racing interests that sought to bid for New York State’s horse-racing franchise.
But it was Mr. Tucker who introduced Fairfield to Mr. Madoff. In the early 1990s, Fairfield began placing money with him, according to George L. Ball, the former president of E. F. Hutton and Prudential-Bache chief executive who knows Mr. Noel socially.
That began a long partnership that helped the Fairfield firm earn enviably steady returns, even in down markets — and that lifted Mr. Madoff into a global orbit, one that soon extended his reach into some of the most fabled banking centers of Europe.
If the wealthy Jewish world he occupied was his launch pad, the wealthy promoters he cultivated at Fairfield Greenwich were his booster rocket.

The Fairfield Sentry fund was one of several so-called feeder funds that became portals through which money from wealthy foreign investors would could capitalize on Mr. Madoff’s investment prowess — collecting those exclusive, steady returns that had made him the toast of Palm Beach and the North Shore so many years ago.
The Sentry fund quickly became Fairfield’s signature product, and it boasted of stellar returns. In marketing materials, Fairfield trumpeted Sentry’s 11 percent annual return over the last 15 years, with only 13 losing months. It was a track record that grew increasingly attractive as markets grew more volatile in recent years.
Though Fairfield Greenwich has its headquarters in New York City and its founder, Mr. Noel, operated from his hometown, Greenwich, Conn., a recent report showed that foreign investors provided 95 percent of its managed assets — with 68 percent in Europe, 6 percent in Asia, and 4 percent in the Middle East.
Friends and associates say that Mr. Noel’s sons-in-law spent much of their time marketing the firm’s funds in either their home countries or regions where they had their own family connections.
One of his most visible representatives was Andrés Piedrahita, a Colombian who had married Mr. Noel’s eldest daughter, Corina, and was eventually named a Fairfield founding partner. Based in Madrid and London, Mr. Piedrahita became one of the firm’s most visible representatives in the world of European banking and investment. But his brothers-in-law also had international roots. Yanko Della Schiava, who married Lisina Noel, was the son of the editor of Cosmopolitan in Italy and of the editor of Harper’s Bazaar in Italy and France. Philip J. Toub, who married Alix Noel, is the son of a director of the Saronic Shipping Company, in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Matthew Brown, who married Marisa Noel, is the son of a former mayor of San Marino, Calif. All three joined Fairfield, eventually becoming partners in marketing.
Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Piedrahita, Mr. Della Schiava and others, Fairfield reaped many millions of dollars in investor capital from Europe. The firm set up feeder programs with institutions like Banco Santander, Swedish Bank Nordea and Banque Benedict Hentsch. All became conduits that carried fresh money to Mr. Madoff.
Among his new investors were the Mugrabis, extremely wealthy art collectors from Colombia who have lived in New York for more 20 years. It was their longtime friendship with Mr. Piedrahita that led them to invest in the Sentry fund.

“We had very little money with the fund — just under a million dollars — so I am not that upset personally,” said Alberto Mugrabi, a son of the family patriarch. “It was a very informal thing. We know Andrés since forever, from Bogotá, he’s a great guy, and he says to us, ‘This is the Madoff thing, he’s the master.’”

He added: “I trusted Andrés. I still trust him.”
The World
Mr. Madoff’s higher profile in the highly competitive world of hedge fund management intensified the skepticism about his remarkably consistent returns. Rival money managers complained that when they sought to replicate his trading strategy based on the statements the Madoff firm sent its clients, they found it wasn’t possible.
There was a scattering of inconclusive regulatory investigations — efforts so unavailing that the chairman of the S.E.C. in Washington has ordered an internal investigation to determine how the agency could have missed so many red flags and ignored so many credible complaints over the years.
But foreign regulators were not any quicker to notice Mr. Madoff’s oddities — or the rapidly expanding pool of money entrusted to the various feeder funds he serviced.
There was the small Austrian merchant bank, Bank Medici, which had $2.1 billion invested in funds that ultimately wound up under Mr. Madoff’s control. It collected those investments through two main funds, the Herald USA Fund and the smaller Herald Luxemburg Fund, sold to banks, insurance companies and pension funds since 2004.
The funds, which were closed for private investors, were incredibly popular among investors and no questions were ever asked about its constant returns of about 7 percent, said a former employee at the bank who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the news media.
Bank Medici sold the funds to investors around the world from its offices in New York, Vienna, Gibraltar, Zurich and Milan. About 93 percent of the funds’ investors are outside Austria. Just last month, the Herald USA fund won Germany’s annual Hedge Fund Awards for “proving consistency in turbulent times.“
Peter Scheithauer, chief executive of Bank Medici since September, accepted the award, saying Bank Medici’s products “should represent mainly one thing: security and returns in good as well as bad times.“

But as he prepared to brief his management board on potential losses connected to the Madoff investments on Friday, he sounded downbeat. “It’s a real tragedy,” Mr. Scheithauer said. “It’s not just us, it’s so many other people as well. If only we knew, but he was paying out fine until just recently.”
Bank Austria, which is now owned by UniCredit of Italy, owns a stake in Bank Medici and also wound up investing with Mr. Madoff through a range of different funds offered under the name Primeo by its hedge fund unit, Pioneer Alternative Investments.
Mr. Madoff was not a well-known presence on the social circuit in Switzerland. Instead, Swiss money managers would go to him, visiting his offices in the Lipstick Building in Midtown Manhattan. Seeing Mr. Madoff there was a bit like visiting the Wizard of Oz: despite his unerring success in generating smooth returns, he seemed quite ordinary, lacking the flamboyance of other well-heeled money managers.
“He did not look like a huge spender; seemed like a family man,” said one veteran Geneva banker, whose firm had money with Mr. Madoff but insisted on anonymity because of the likelihood of lawsuits from angry clients. “He talked about the markets.”
The only thing that struck the Swiss banker as odd was the bull memorabilia strewn about his office. “It seemed strange for a guy to have all these bulls, little sculptures, paintings of bulls,” he recalled. “I’ve seen offices with bears. This was bulls.”
But the aura of exclusivity was the constant, he said. “This was the usual spiel: ‘It’s impossible to get in, but we can get you some if you’re nice.’ He made it look difficult to get into.”
New Frontiers
What began as a quietly coveted investment opportunity for the lucky few in the Jewish country clubs on Long Island became, in its final burst of growth, a thoroughly global financial product whose roots were obscured behind legions of well-dressed, multilingual sales representatives in the financial capitals of Europe.
Indeed, often with the assistance of feeder funds, Mr. Madoff was now in a position to seek and procure money from Arab investors, too. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the largest of the world’s sovereign wealth funds, with assets estimated earlier this year to be approaching $700 billion, wound up in the same boat as Jewish charities in New York: caught in the collapse of Bernie Madoff.

Continue reading the main story
In early 2005, the investment authority had invested approximately $400 million with Mr. Madoff, by way of the Fairfield Sentry Fund, according to a profile of the firm that it prepared for a prospective buyer in 2007. Fairfield Sentry had more than $7 billion invested with Mr. Madoff and was his largest investor; now, it says, it is his largest victim.
The investment authority, in turn, was one of Fairfield Sentry’s largest investors. Even after the investment authority took two significant redemptions from the fund, in April 2005 and 2006, its stake the following year of $132 million made up 2 percent of the fund’s assets under management.
The 2007 report lists Philip Jamchid Toub, one of Mr. Noel’s sons-in-law, as the firm’s “agent” with the Abu Dhabi investors, presumably meaning the person who manages the relationship with the particular clients. Mr. Toub, a Fairfield Greenwich partner, is married to Alix Noel and is the son of Said Toub, a wealthy shipping executive from Switzerland.
Other investors for whom Mr. Toub is listed as the agent include the Safra National Bank of New York and the National Bank of Kuwait.
And Fairfield was finding new fields for Mr. Madoff to cultivate. In 2004, the firm turned its eyes to Asia, forming a partnership with Lion Capital of Singapore, now Lion Global Investors, to create Lion Fairfield Capital Management, a joint venture meant to introduce Asian investors to the firm.
“Many investors believe that Asia holds the best global opportunities for hedge funds over the next two to five years, as compared to the U.S. and Europe,” Richard Landsberger, a Fairfield partner and director of Lion Fairfield, told HedgeWorld in 2006.
Yet it appears that Sentry remained Fairfield’s chief focus in this new vineyard. Among the institutions that had invested in the fund are Korea Life Insurance, which has about $30 million to $50 million in the fund; a Taiwanese insurer, Cathay Life, with about $12 million; and Samsung Investment and Securities, with about $6.3 million.
As Fairfield moved into Asia, another feeder fund, Stellar US Absolute Return, was incorporated in Singapore in 2006 to funnel investors’ capital into Sentry. According to data from Bloomberg News, Stellar borrowed $3 for every dollar of investor money it received, in an effort to extract higher returns.

Last year, Jeffrey Tucker went to Asia to educate potential investors in Beijing and Thailand about hedge funds, seeking to allay their concerns about previous blow-ups in the industry like Long-Term Capital Management, a Connecticut hedge fund that had been rescued under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when its exotic derivative investments brought it to the brink of a costly collapse.
“China is moving slowly as the reformers become familiar with what we do,” Mr. Tucker told HedgeWorld in November 2007. “It’s the same thing in Thailand. There are misunderstandings about hedge funds.”
The Scheme Collapses
But even with all the money pouring in, it was not enough, not in a year in which financial markets were plunging.
Suddenly, people wanted cash — even the people who had trusted their cash for so long to Mr. Madoff. Time was running out for history’s first worldwide Ponzi scheme.
But he maintained a brave face at the family firm that he had founded before his sons Mark and Andrew were born, and where they now worked, the firm where his brother Peter had labored at his side for decades, the firm that remained a stock-trading powerhouse on Wall Street.
But that trading business lived on the 18th and 19th floors of the Third Avenue tower, called the Lipstick Building, that was home to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. Mr. Madoff operated his vast but largely unseen “asset management” business from the 17th floor, aided by a small staff that had been with him for years and a computer system separate from the trading business.
His family knew Mr. Madoff had an investment management business, but Mr. Madoff had always kept it separate. Moreover, he explained that he placed his trades through “European counterparties” rather than use the trading desks his sons oversaw.
But Mark and Andrew felt their father had been under increasing tension as the markets grew increasingly difficult this fall.

In early December he remarked to one of them that he was struggling to raise $7 billion to cover redemptions. He seemed tired and drawn, but so was just about everyone else during the turbulent weeks of late November and early December.
Then, early on Dec. 10, he shocked his sons by suggesting that the firm pay out several million dollars in bonuses two months ahead of schedule. When pressed by his sons for a reason, he grew agitated and insisted that they all leave the office and continue the conversation at his apartment on East 64th Street.
It was there, at midmorning, that he told his sons that his business was “a big lie” and, “basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.” There was nothing left, he told them — and he fully expected to go to jail.
The questions have piled up since then: Could Mr. Madoff have sustained this worldwide fraud for so long by himself? Why didn’t regulators, in Washington and abroad, catch him sooner? And will anything be recovered for investors, some of whom have lost every penny?
But when the news of his arrest began to spread on Dec. 11, the first thought that struck an old friend who had known him as a pioneer on Wall Street, was, “There must be an error. It must be another Bernie Madoff.” Then he added, “But then, there is no other Bernie Madoff.”
Correction: December 29, 2008
An article on Dec. 20 about Bernard L. Madoff, charged with running a global Ponzi scheme, misidentified the position held by James A. Stern at Tufts University at the time it invested indirectly in Mr. Madoff’s fund. Mr. Stern was chairman of the university’s board and was a member of its investment committee; he was not chairman of the investment committee.
This article was reported by Diane B. Henriques, Alex Berenson, Alison Leigh Cowan, Alan Feuer, Zachery Kouwe, Eric Konigsberg, Nelson D. Schwartz, Michael J. de la Merced, Stephanie Strom, Julia Werdigier and Dirk Johnson.

Mathieu Valbuena (g) et Karim Benzema pose avant le match amical de l'équipe de France face à la Jamaïque au stade Pierre-Mauroy, le 8 juin 2014

Banales techniques d'enquêteur ou égarement d'un limier pousse-au-crime ? La justice examine vendredi les méthodes policières employées dans l'enquête sur la tentative de chantage à la sex-tape contre Mathieu Valbuena, jugées déloyales par les suspects, dont Karim Benzema, qui réclament l'annulation de l'ensemble de la procédure.
La chambre de l'instruction de la cour d'appel de Versailles doit notamment se pencher sur la validité d'une des pièces maîtresses du dossier: les négociations téléphoniques entre un policier qui se faisait passer pour un homme de confiance de Valbuena, ""M. Lucas"", et un maître chanteur.
En juin 2015, Valbuena avait reçu un appel d'un inconnu lui affirmant détenir une vidéo intime le concernant. Le maître-chanteur lui proposait de trouver un arrangement, sans évoquer le montant à payer, conduisant le footballeur à déposer plainte.
Une longue négociation avait alors commencé entre le policier sous couverture et l'escroc, nourrie d'appels téléphoniques répétés, certains à l'initiative de l'enquêteur qui relançait avec insistance le maître chanteur.
""C'est une provocation à l'infraction: on ne saura jamais ce qui se serait passé si le policier n'avait pas rappelé"", soutient l'avocat du corbeau, Me Marion Ménage qui, au-delà de l'annulation de cette seule pièce, demande que tous les actes de procédure postérieurs tombent - soit l'ensemble du dossier.
L'enquête avait ensuite permis d'identifier les deux cerveaux présumés de l'entreprise de chantage: Mustapha Zouaoui et Axel Angot, qui gravitent depuis des années autour des footballeurs.
Pour l'avocat du premier, Me Serge Money, ""il y a eu déloyauté: ce policier s'est emballé, il a été virulent, il a poussé (le corbeau) à donner des preuves, il lui demande combien il veut... On a l'impression qu'il voulait monter un beau dossier"".
Zouaoui et Angot s'étaient ensuite tournés vers Karim Zenati, un ami d'enfance de Karim Benzema, attaquant au Real Madrid et co-équipier de Valbuena en équipe de France, afin qu'il fasse pression sur le joueur de l'Olympique lyonnais et le convainque de payer.
Tous ont été mis en exmaen pour tentative de chantage, complicité et participation à une association de malfaiteurs.
Benzema, privé d'Euro-2016 en raison de cette affaire, est toutefois désormais ""sélectionnable"" en équipe de France, a estimé la semaine dernière le président de la Fédération française de football, Noël le Graët.

Les magistrats de la chambre de l'instruction doivent également examiner vendredi une demande, formulée par le parquet, de mise en examen de l'ex-footballeur Djibril Cissé, qui avait fait état à Valbuena dès mai 2015 de ""murmures"" quant à la circulation d'une vidéo.
Placé en garde à vue à l'automne 2015, Cissé en était ressorti libre, sans aucune charge contre lui, après avoir convaincu les enquêteurs de sa bonne foi.
L'accusation a depuis changé d'avis: ""des éléments médiatiques laissent perplexes quant à la bienveillance de Cissé à l'égard de Valbuena"", notamment ""son intervention dans l'émission Touche pas à mon poste"" sur D8, a expliqué à l'AFP une source proche du dossier.
Lors de cette prestation télévisée d'octobre 2015, Cissé avait expliqué que ""(c'était) un truc qui aurait pu être très mauvais pour moi et pour (Mathieu Valbuena) alors qu'il n'y a rien. On est venu me chercher pour écouter ma partie de l'histoire. Moi je n'ai jamais escroqué personne. Mathieu est un ami!""
Insuffisant, toutefois, pour la juge d'instruction Nathalie Boutard (depuis remplacée par une nouvelle magistrate à la tête de l'enquête, Christelle Boynton), qui avait jugé inutile toute poursuite. Le parquet a fait appel de ce refus.
De même, les juges d'appel sont saisis vendredi de diverses demandes: le parquet exige notamment une confrontation entre Zouaoui, Angot et Cissé, une autre entre Valbuena et Cissé. La défense de Benzema réclame pour sa part l'audition des internationaux français Patrice Evra et Raphaël Varane, ainsi qu'une quinzaine de pontes de l'équipe de France, du sélectionneur Didier Deschamps au cuisinier, responsable des contenus numériques et ostéopathe compris."

Bernie and Ruth Madoff: questions are being asked about how much Ruth Madoff knew about the fraud

Lord Jacobs of Belgravia, who has a house in Palm Beach and whose fortune is estimated at £128 million in this year's Rich List
Wealthy London peer Lord Jacobs of Belgravia today admits he suffered 'a real loss' at the hands of Bernie Madoff as investigators examine role of his wife Ruth...
The former Liberal Democrat peer Lord Jacobs of Belgravia today revealed that he was a victim of Bernie Madoff, the American fraudster whose $50 billion scam has plunged New York and London investment markets into turmoil. As investigators in the United States and London continued their probe into Madoff's affairs, Lord Jacobs disclosed to the Evening Standard that he had suffered ""a real loss"".
He declined to put a figure on the amount but said: ""It's not peanuts,"" reflecting the fact that Madoff demanded at least $1 million from his wealthy clients and encouraged them to invest $10 million or more.
The 78-year-old peer is spending Christmas at his holiday home in Palm Beach, Florida, where he first met Madoff. ""Such a charming man,"" he said. ""He was obviously very wealthy but he didn't live high on the hog. I used to see him and we'd chat. He seemed like a very nice guy.""
Lord Jacobs, whose fortune was estimated at £128 million in this year's Sunday Times Rich List, prospered with businesses including the British School of Motoring and fast food chains - Spudulike was one of his brands. He is thought to have given the Liberals and Lib-Dems more than £1 million over the past 20 years but he recently left the party to become a crossbencher. He cited differences with leader Nick Clegg over tax policies.
Like many casualties of 70-year-old Madoff's fraud, Lord Jacobs was drawn into the scheme through social contacts in the wealthy Jewish community in Palm Beach. This was one of the main centres of Madoff's operations where, according to the Standard's inquiries, he operated with a cynicism that was breathtaking. While he and his wife Ruth were befriending people, his so-called fund was robbing them.
Now friends, such as Lord Jacobs, are left wondering how much the elegant and highly-likeable Mrs Madoff knew about what was happening. ""It seems impossible that he could have acted alone,"" Lord Jacobs said. ""I found Ruth a rather quiet lady, concerned with her charity work. But she's certainly no fool and his sons were closely involved in the business.""
Investigators working for the Securities and Exchange Commission have discovered evidence that Mrs Madoff, 67, monitored financial transactions in her husband's firm. It was also reported in New York that the SEC had discovered her name on a number of deals. She has been asked to surrender her passport and is expected to be questioned in the coming days.
Mrs Madoff met her husband when they were students. They have two sons, Andrew and Mark, both in their 40s. Mrs Madoff, who once published a best-selling book on kosher cooking, has a reputation for being a staunch supporter of the Democrat Party. She and her husband have given more than $100,000 to candidates to the Senate and other political posts. One report suggested they were ""A-List"" donors who had given more than $250,000 to the Democrats.
Now her husband is confined to their £5 million duplex apartment on New York's Upper East side. He is allowed out during the day but must wear an electronic tag. Mrs Madoff and his brother Peter posted $10 million bail to keep him out of prison.
""I don't suppose I shall see him again,"" Lord Jacobs said, ""but if I did I should like to ask him this: 'Bernie, you had a very good business. You were doing so well. Why did you do it?'""
The answer to that question has not yet become clear but investigators are beginning to believe that Madoff turned crook only relatively recently. According to sources in New York, the SEC believes Madoff started stealing from his clients in earnest in 2005. At that time he faced a run of calls for cash from investors who wanted to take out their money to cover losses elsewhere. Signs of panic are evident in the figures the SEC has uncovered. This year, Madoff filed documents claiming he had $17.1 billion under management in his funds. As stock values dived he reported a mark-up of 5.6 per cent at the end of November. At the same time stocks in Standard and Poor's 500 index fell by nearly 38 per cent.
This was the market in which Madoff was doing most of his trades and it was unthinkable that he could have profited so handsomely when virtually everyone else was losing. Yet the truth emerged only when his fund clients tried to cash in a total of $7 billion. Madoff had to admit the money wasn't there and the whole thing had been a charade or, as he himself put it, a ""giant Ponzi scheme"", a pyramid fraud in which money from new investors was used to pay phoney returns.
Lord Jacobs first gave him money to invest 10 years ago. He said: ""I met a friend of mine at the club in Palm Beach one day and we discussed investments. He said he had been investing with Bernie Madoff for about seven years. I liked the sound of it because it gave a reasonable return and it didn't have the risks you have with hedge funds. He was giving about 10 per cent a year and while you could get much more from a hedge fund you are also exposed to big losses. Madoff was not borrowing to invest, which made it that much more secure.
""The money came in every month. There was very quick liquidity. If people asked for their money back, they got it.""
Around the time Lord Jacobs started investing with Madoff the fund was subjected to an investigation by the SEC. The peer said: ""Apart from finding one or two minor things wrong, they gave it a clean bill of health. When a body like that gives the all clear, it gives you confidence. Now we know that the SEC so grossly failed. If it had done its work properly, it would have realised it was all a fraud.""
The SEC has faced severe criticism for not acting on a series of warnings about Madoff's operation. Lord Jacobs said: ""If the SEC had gone to the auditors and asked to see the working papers, it would have realised something was wrong in one minute flat. It didn't do that."" He has taken legal advice in London and believes the SEC may be held liable for its failures.
""The US government has a role in this. Regulatory bodies are expected to regulate. I have incurred a real loss. But there are people here in Palm Beach who have been wiped out. They will never recover. Pensions have gone, life savings have been lost. For those people what has happened is a catastrophe.""
Investigators have seen evidence that Madoff recently made a desperate plea to his rich investors for more money. Fairfield Greenwich, the firm run by Walter Noel which is the single biggest Madoff loser with $7.5 billion missing, poured in millions of dollars during the past few weeks at Madoff's request. The company, which has a big London operation run by Andres Piedrahita and his wife Corina, Noel's daughter, who live in Belgravia, took money from other funds to give to Madoff. It seems Madoff was making a last-ditch attempt to plug the gaps, recklessly throwing other people's money into a yawning financial abyss.
Lord Jacobs said he was not asked for more money recently but others with Palm Beach connections were not so fortunate. Madoff and his wife socialised at the Palm Beach Country Club, an exclusive members-only establishment that does not encourage visitors. It doesn't even have a sign outside the high hedge around the clubhouse, and its golf course is shielded from the road.
Lord Jacobs met Madoff through contacts at the club, as did many other of his victims . One was 95-year-old textile magnate Carl Shapiro. He and his son-in-law Robert Jaffe are believed to have lost more than $400 million. Mr Shapiro's charitable foundation has seen another $145 million disappear.
Just weeks ago Madoff asked them for more money. The Shapiros sent a cheque for an undisclosed sum, thought to be in the millions. Mr Shapiro's wife Ruth, 91, said: ""He seemed a little anxious this time. He kept calling, saying, 'I didn't get it; it hasn't come yet. Are you sure you sent it?'"" Unluckily for the Shapiros, they had.
Madoff's home in Palm Beach seems locked up and deserted, although a Mini Cooper and a silver grey Lexus have been parked on the drive in recent days. The house, on North Lake Way near the intercoastal waterway, was once owned by the Pulitzer family. It has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and the living area covers 6,500 square feet, nearly five times the space in a typical three-bedroom London home. It has been valued at $9.4  million. Like other Madoff properties, ownership is registered in the name of his wife, Ruth.
The house has its own dock but a boat that neighbours used to see tied up there has gone, possibly to protect it from being grabbed by investors.
Anger over Madoff's fraud is running high and a lot has been directed against the Madoffs as a couple. A Palm Beach socialite said Ruth played a crucial role in getting people to invest. She said: ""They were a real pair at the country club. Networking among very rich people there is about the best on earth. When there is a cocktail party, husbands always bring their wives and people would try to get to Bernie through Ruth.""
Madoff created an illusion of exclusivity around his fund and declined some investors, apparently to sharpen interest. As one Palm Beach resident said, without conscious irony: ""You felt you'd really arrived if Bernie let you in on his scheme.""

Pennywise: will release ninth album free for two weeks through MySpace
Tuesday 20 November 2007 15.32 GMT
First published on Tuesday 20 November 2007 15.32 GMT
MySpace will release an album to users for free next year as part of a campaign to create a mass-market, advertising-supported free music service.
The site will offer the ninth album by Southern Californian punk band Pennywise in full, with no charge to users, from March 25.
MySpace Records, the site's spin-off label, has signed a deal with the band to make their album available worldwide.
Web users will have two weeks to download the album and its artwork, which will be sponsored by mobile music marketing firm Textango. Fans will also be able to buy the album In the traditional CD and DVD formats.
The MySpace co-founder and president, Tom Anderson, said the deal is ""just the beginning of a high volume of cutting-edge music programming"", hinting at further deals and expanding on MySpace's core following of music fans.
Travis Katz, the managing director of MySpace International, said that MySpace ""likes the idea of being disruptive and experimenting with new things"".
The Pennywise announcement follows a high-profile trial by Radiohead, who offered their new album, In Rainbows, online and left it to fans to decide how much to pay.
MySpace has an existing deal to sell downloads in the US through Snocap, but the Fox Interactive Media company is expected to announce a major expansion of its downloads service through a link-up with music labels.
Mr Katz said he wasn't sure that the Snocap model would be the way forward.
""You can imagine in a time of transition everyone sees the world a little bit differently,"" he said.

35,"Madoff case to rock already shaky hedge funds

n"">BOSTON/NEW YORK Dec 12 (Reuters) - Bernard Madoff has single-handedly turned an already very bad year for hedge funds into a catastrophe.
Now the industry's already steep losses may grow even larger, dozens of funds might collapse and confidence eroded even more after a 70-year old New York-based investor allegedly cheated investors from Palm Beach, to New York, to Geneva to Madrid out of as much as $50 billion.
""You already have a crisis of confidence because of the falling stock market,"" said Charles Gradante, who selects hedge funds for clients as a co-founder of the Hennessee Group.
""Now that crisis has broadened to hedge funds directly because Bernie Madoff seems to have pulled off a gigantic fraud for so many years.""
Panicked hedge fund investors hearing tales of how Madoff cheated his clients might worry they cannot trust their own managers either, investors and industry lawyers said.
""If this had happened any earlier in the year, you would have seen even more people trying to run for the exits,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisor.
The $1.5 trillion industry has been flooded with redemption notices for months as investors react to the industry's deepest ever losses of 18 percent.
Indeed, the panic will likely spread into next year.
""Anyone on the fence regarding redemptions to the fund industry over the next several months will likely put in their requests for capital withdrawal, as confidence in the system and in investment managers has been irreparably impaired,"" said Doug Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management.
For years Madoff played the part of a solid investment manager by boasting on his website about the firm's ""unblemished record of value, fair-dealing and high ethical standards.""
His office was filled with computer banks, there was little paper and he reflected the industry's reputation for secrecy by telling would-be investors very little about how he worked, people who know him remembered.
""Madoff's outfit was such a black box,"" said Salomon Konig, who helps endowments and wealthy families select hedge funds as chief investment officer at Artemis Capital Partners.
Konig was so worried that he told funds of hedge funds he was not interested in doing business with them if they were involved with with Madoff, a society lion known for his affable manner at charity functions.
But plenty of other investors were less careful and downright eager to invest with Madoff, whose records showed he lost money in only five of 156 months, several people familiar with his clientele said.
Tremont Capital was an early fan, the people said. Also hedge funds Fairfield Sentry, run by Walter Noel, and Kingate Global Fund, were known as feeder funds for Madoff. And Spanish group BBVA had offered U.S. based advisors a chance to put their clients' money in his hands.
As the list of people linked with Madoff grows, industry experts believe the pain will be felt far and wide.
""This will be a who's who of people caught with him,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors.
Already rumors are swirling about funds that will be wiped out by the alleged fraud.
""Is this going to be the nail in the coffin for a few hedge funds already teetering on the edge, I absolutely think so,"" said Peter Turecek, a managing director at Kroll Inc, a risk consultancy owned by Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc.
Another major result from the Madoff case will be an increase in hedge fund surveillance.
""A lot of people treat due diligence as a check the box kind of endeavor and this is a poster-child case for why you need to do real due diligence,"" Turecek added.  (Editing by Andre Grenon)

About the author
Tom Griffin is a Ph.D researcher at the University of Bath and a freelance writer. He is a former Executive Editor of the Irish World.
Tom Griffin (London,  OK ):Perhaps it's something to do with his Freudian slip during the week, but Gordon Brown's bailout plan for the British economy has come in for some sceptical scrutiny in the Sundays today, and not just from his opponents on the right.
In The Herald , Iain MacWhirter agrees with German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck's critique of Brown's approach:
The government seems to think it can turn the clock back to 2007 - but the clock is broken. There must be a return to a savings culture. There must be reform of the housing market to prevent another boom, new rules for the Bank of England to curb asset bubbles. We need regulation of derivatives markets and closure of the tax havens which allowed banks to set up shadow entities. The hedge fund industry, which was based on abuse of tax havens, needs to be dismantled as a matter of urgency. As is becoming clear from scandals like that of Bernie Madoff, who ran a £50 billion scam, the hedge funds were essentially Ponzi pyramid schemes built on leveraged debt.
In the Observer, Andrew Rawnsley also picks up on Steinbrueck's comments, in arguing for a greater focus on investment rather than reflating consumption:
A modernised rail system, a national fibre optic network and a  renewable energy grid: all have the triple merit of generating business  in Britain, creating jobs in Britain and enhancing Britain's  competitiveness. They are not make-work schemes of the sort that can  give infrastructure projects a bad name when money is spent building  bridges to nowhere. All these projects meet a national need and will  leave a profitable legacy.
Interestingly, one recent government estimate suggests that the cost of a national fibre-optic network could be between £5 billion and £30 billion, depending on the technology used, a strikingly similar range to the competing estimates of the cost of ID cards ."

Why Bernie Did It
An ex-con who served five prison sentences on Madoff's delusions—and why his victims didn't want him to get caught.
What, if anything, do the recent mind-boggling revelations about Bernard Madoff say about the rest of us? What makes us so prone to flim-flamming our fellow beings?
As a self-made expert in the art of cheating—I’m an ex-con who made an excellent living out of manufacturing credit cards and served five prison sentences for my pains—I know something about the matter.
Bear in mind that the most heinous people in history—Jack the Ripper, Hitler, Pol Pot, Jeffrey Dahmer, not to speak of Blago and “Uncle Bernie”—never see themselves as monsters. If the human mind allowed that self-assessment, the villain would be thwarted by madness, locked into an eternal game of mental handball with his own shit. Spend some time behind bars and you’ll soon realize that every form of human behavior, no matter how far beyond the pale, can be rationalized as “normal.”
Take it from one knows: Over time Madoff began to believe in his own bullshit. The mind—especially the criminal mind—works that way.
If I dwell on my years as a grifter, it’s only to prepare you for how Bernie Madoff will behave in the dock. It was only during my last stint in a Federal pen that I was able to admit to myself that I’d devoted a tremendous worth ethic—I rarely took days off even when rolling in filthy lucre—to pursuing a life of crime. But if the Feds do put Madoff away, I bet he’ll still see himself as only a gambler who had a run of bad luck, albeit with other folks’ money.
To be frank, I seriously doubt if Madoff set out, with malice aforethought, to defraud anyone. Further, like all gamblers, he felt that his luck would one day turn around and he’d be able to cover all his bets, as well as his own ass. I know that the folks he scammed don’t want to hear this, but Madoff probably thought, right up to the end, that he was going to be able to pull everyone’s chestnuts out of the fire, that everything was going to be fine and dandy.
Take it from one knows: Over time Madoff became delusional; he began to believe in his own bullshit. The mind—especially the criminal mind—works that way. You’ve seen the sweatshirts: “I’ve given up on reality …” Well, Madoff moved into a fabulous reality all his own—a dream castle that didn’t cost him a dime.
As with most criminals, his wrongdoing was rooted in hubris: he was the Money Magician who couldn’t bring himself to be the bearer of the bad news that he was wiping out his clients’ investments, charitable contributions and life-savings. After all, many of those he was scamming were “friends.” He was an emotional cripple who pleased people to gain their adulation. His victims were the enablers of his self-importance.
As for his vaunted excursions into philanthropy, that too was a prop—a benevolent beard in his elaborate disguise. Hell, the women on my counterfeiting crew, after spending a hard day going from casino to casino obtaining fraudulent $5,000 cash advances with the manufactured plastic (traffic on the Vegas Strip can really be brutal), would spend their evenings channel-surfing for charitable telethons. More than once, they put Jerry’s Kids over the top with their late-night “dialing for dollars,” as they came to call it. It made them feel so damn good about themselves—a washing away of the day’s sins.
If Madoff is ultimately sentenced to prison, he will no doubt go quietly off to the oblivion that Federal pens provide for celebrity wizards like him.Yet we are not likely to have learned any lessons from his rise and fall.
Why? Because Americans worship—we just flat-out love—larger-than-life criminals. We love them like old folks love soft footwear—like Madoff’s clients loved cushy, hand-sewn shoes. It’s only the run-of-the-mill, garden-variety criminal that we loathe—the purse snatcher, the crack addict. We don’t make movies about them. Whenever I tell someone about my criminal background, the question is never “Why?” but “How?” How did I get that magnetic strip to actually work? I’m still not telling. But a couple of folks did try to get me to write a screenplay about my exploits. One of the best-selling video games instructs players in the skills of car jacking. As you read this, somebody is undoubtedly pitching a movie called “Madoff;” somebody is working up a video game called “Bernie’s Billions.”
It takes two to make a crime. Joseph “Yellow Kid” Weil, one of the most successful swindlers of all time—he once talked the detective who was escorting him to prison into buying $30,000 in phony stock—observed: “Each of my victims had larceny in his heart. The desire to get something for nothing has been very costly to many people who have dealt with me and with other con men. But I have found that this is the way it works. The average person, in my estimation, is ninety-nine percent animal and one percent human. The ninety-nine percent that is animal causes very little trouble. But the one percent that is human causes all our woes.""
Despite all the red flags waved about the Madoff scam, I’m not surprised that apparently none of his investors wised up, or that even those who might have suspected what he was up to called for an investigation. The only thing they would have said to their patron was: “Don’t get caught.” They were like the casino tellers, the diamond merchants, the maitre d’s who couldn’t contain their glee when I walked into their establishment at the height of my criminal career. Nobody raised an eyebrow at the frequency of my visits to the casino’s cash window. As the teller counted out the maximum cash advance of five-grand, I’d say, “Oh, you miscounted,” and slip a hundred-dollar bill back into the waiting hand. After that, I owned him.
So what should we do about Bernard Madoff? Don’t send Madoff off to some cushy Federal pen, where he’ll find a way to make himself the big man on that campus. Instead, keep him confined in his Manhattan apartment all alone—no telephone, no TV, no computer showing dizzying stock prices to make him nostalgic for his days of glory. Brick every window up. Let him stare at his own walls for the rest of his life.
I know: it won’t get anyone’s money back. The only consolation for the thousands of his gullible victims is to remember what the carnival barker barks: “You place your bets, and you take your chances.” After all, Madoff didn’t pull a gun on anyone—now did he?

ampnet – Blitzlichtgewitter heute am frühen Morgen in Hannover. Vor dem Beginn der 55. Volkswagen-Hauptversammlung schreitet Konzernchef Prof. Dr. Martin Winterkorn, begleitet von Wolfgang Porsche und Niedersachsens Ministerpräsident Stephan Weil, durch die Messehallen der Landeshauptstadt. Fein aufgereiht und poliert stehen hier die automobilen Modelle der zwölf Marken des VW-Konzerns. Dem kritischen Blick Winterkorns entgeht nichts. Routiniert schaut der Konzernchef auf jedes Detail und ist dabei stolz auf seine Mannschaft. „Mich hat sehr bewegt, wie die Mannschaft in den letzten Wochen kein bisschen nachgelassen hat. Alle haben mit unverändert hohem Einsatz dafür gearbeitet, die besten Autos für unsere Kunden auf die Straße zu bringen“, sagte er vor dem Hintergrund des inzwischen beigelegten Streits um seine Zukunft.
Ferner hieß Winterkorn die beiden neuen Aufsichtsratsmitglieder Louise Kießling und Julia Kuhn-Piëch Willkommen und lobte das Lebenswerk des ausgeschiedenen Ferdinand Piëch, der in den vergangenen Wochen versucht hatte, am Stuhl des Vorstandsvorsitzenden zu sägen. „Mir ist es wichtig, an dieser Stelle Herrn Dr. Piëch zu danken – im Namen aller 600 000 Mitarbeiter, aber auch persönlich. Ferdinand Piëch hat die Automobilindustrie in den vergangenen fünf Jahrzehnten geprägt, wie kein Zweiter – als Unternehmer, als Ingenieur, als mutiger Visionär. Dieser Konzern und seine Menschen haben Herrn Dr. Piëch sehr viel zu verdanken. Das bleibt. Und vor dieser Lebensleistung haben wir und habe ich großen Respekt“, führte Winterkorn aus und ging anschließend zur Tagesordnung über.
Winterkorn hob das erfolgreiche China-Geschäft hervor und die mehr als zehn Millionen Auslieferungen im vergangenen Jahr. Die Umsätze lagen erstmals bei über 200 Milliarden Euro. Die Rendite vor Steuern liegt bei 7,3 Prozent. „Bis 2018 sollen es mehr als acht Prozent sein“, hob der Konzernchef hervor. Jedes achte weltweit verkaufte neue Fahrzeug ist aus dem Volkswagen-Konzern. Das Unternehmen will ferner seinen globalen Produktionsverbund optimieren. Soll heißen: Der Tiguan wird künftig auch in Mexiko gebaut, und den Polo wird es fortan nur noch als Viertürer geben. Alleine dadurch soll ein dreistelliger Millionenbetrag eingespart werden. Ferner plant Volkswagen den 1,4-Liter TDI-Motor mit drei Zylindern aus dem Programm zu nehmen.

Im Fokus des Interesses stand für die Aktionäre auch das US-Geschäft des Konzerns. „Nach großem Erfolgen hat die Marke Volkswagen hier an Tempo verloren“, musste Martin Winterkorn einräumen. Die Konsequenzen seien gezogen worden. VW will dort seine Modelle in deutlich kürzeren Abständen erneuern. Bereits im zweiten Halbjahr 2015 soll der neue US-Passat auf den Markt kommen, und Ende 2016 feiert das neue Mid-Size-SUV seine Premiere. 2017 soll auch der Tiguan mit verlängertem Radstand nach Amerika kommen. Sein Produktionsstandort wird Puebla in Mexiko.
Für China treibt Volkswagen die Entwicklung eines kostengünstigen Budget-Cars voran. Allerdings nicht zu jedem Preis. Solch ein Modell soll, wie die anderen Autos auch, eine angemessene Rendite abwerfen. Für das laufende Jahr peilt Volkswagen an, dass der Umsatz in Abhängigkeit von den konjunkturellen Rahmenbedingungen um bis zu vier Prozent wächst. Im Bereich Pkw wird mit einer operativen Rendite von bis zu sieben Prozent gerechnet. Mit Sorge hingegen blckt die Industrie nach Russland. Dieser Markt ist innerhalb eines Jahres um 40 Prozent eingebrochen. Der zunehmenden, globalen Unsicherheit gilt es mit Augenmaß zu begegnen. Das gilt besonders für die Truck-Märkte und das Südamerika-Geschäft, hieß es auf der Hauptversammlung.
Der modulare Querbaukasten wirft erste Früchte ab. 2015 wird der Konzern bereits 2,7-Millionen Fahrzeuge auf MQB-Basis produzieren. 2018 sollen es sieben-Millionen sein. Wirtschaftlich habe das Unternehmen mit 3,3 Milliarden Euro im operativen Ergebnis im ersten Quartal den besten Jahresauftakt seiner Geschichte hingelegt, wurde verkünder. Das Programm Future Tracks ist auf gutem Weg. „Auf lange Sicht wollen wir Volkswagen vom Autobauer zum globalen Mobilitätsanbieter machen“, erklärte Winterkorn. Dazu gehören die Elektromobilität und die digitale Welt. Dabei geht es darum dass Ingenieure und IT-Profis gemeinsam das Automobil noch intelligenter, sicherer und effizienter machen. In den kommenden fünf Jahren wird der Konzern deshalb mehr als 85-Milliarden Euro in Produkte, Technologien und Werke investieren. Dazu kommen 22 Milliarden Euro Investment durch die chinesischen Joint Ventures. (ampnet/tw) Von Tim Westermann Auto-Medienportal.Net"

Mets Owner Among Hedge Fund Fraud Victims
By RICHARD ESPOSITO
The news of Bernard Madoff 's alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme sent shock waves down Wall Street this morning, but it seems enough 'red flags' had been raised by at least one due diligence firm to steer some hedge fund

managers, high net worth individuals, and institutional investors away. Yet it was also revealed today that even the owner of the Mets baseball team is among his victims.
The powerful New York financial advisor whose handful of clients routinely expected -- and received -- double digit returns, up market or down, may have instead been running a decades-long scheme that defrauded investors of $50 billion, according to a one-count criminal complaint unsealed Thursday in federal court in New York. Madoff, 70, a former chairman of NASDAQ, was an investment adviser who catered to a handful of high net worth clients, one of whom told ABC News that Madoff was so sought after that, as recently as two months ago, he was turning down potential new business.
Employees of the firm are now packing up their belongings and some have lost their life savings. But the research firm Aksia which also provides advice to pensions, endowments, foundations and insurance companies, says they were already steering clients away from Madoff's hedge fund based on a ""host of red flags.""
According to the letter to its clients, Aksia ""published extensive reports on several of the 'feeder funds' which allocated their capital to Madoff Securities ... Our judgment was swift, given the extensive list of red flags.""
Aksia said in its letter that when the firm checked the auditor of Madoff's fund they found the operation was quite small, given the amount of money being handled.
The accounting firm, says Aksia, had just three employees, ""of which one was 78 years old and living in Florida, one was a secretary, and one was an active 47-year-old accountant (and the office in Rockland County, N.Y., was only 13 ft x 18 ft large).""
In addition to Aksia, today news began to swirl around the case that raised questions as to whether the Securities and Exchange Commission had responded appropriately to other red flags raised earlier by investors.
Mets Owner's Firm Invested With Madoff
Other investors large and small, however, appeared today to be suffering from their trust in Madoff.
Fred Wilpon, owner of the New York Mets baseball team, is chairman of the board and co-founder of Sterling Equities, a firm that invested with Madoff.
Sterling Equities today issued a statement that said, ""Among our various investments, we have accounts managed by Madoff Securities. We are shocked by recent events and, like all investors, will continue to monitor the situation.""
Sterling has been hurt before by funds that turned out to be frauds. The firm, which has developed 17 million square feet of commercial real estate and owns the New York Mets, also funded Sterling Stamos Capital, in which it maintained a limited partner minority interest. That fund invested in Bayou Capital, and subsequently was damaged when it turned out that Bayou, run by Sam Israel III, was something of a Ponzi scheme itself. Israel was convicted of fraud, sentenced to 20 years and subsequently tried to escape imprisonment by faking his own death earlier this year.
An individual investor with Madoff told ABC that ""the only risk with Bernie Madoff was the risk that occurred -- it turned out to be a Ponzi scheme."" The strategy that Madoff took, according to the statements he delivered to investors, was one in which he ""collared"" a stock, taking put and call positions while holding the underlying stock in the client account. If the strategy were utilized, generally speaking, if the market soared, there would be a limit on how much of the gain the investor would share. But conversely, if the market tanked, the investor would not be swimming naked at low tide, the investor's exposure would be limited.
SEC Alleges a 'Stunning Fraud'
ABCNews.com called the SEC in New York and Washington numerous times regarding earlier investigations into Madoff funds and whether or not the red flags raised by investment advisors were brought to the attention of the SEC.
A SEC spokesman responded Friday evening with this statement:
""The staff of the SEC's New York Regional Office completed two inquiries into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in 2005 and 2007. Staff from the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations completed a broker-dealer examination in 2005, finding three violations of 'best execution' rules. Staff from the Division of Enforcement in New York completed an investigation in 2007, and did not refer the matter to the Commission for enforcement action. In response to recent new evidence, the New York Regional Office recommenced its investigation of Madoff and referred the matter to the Commission for enforcement action on December 11, 2008.""
The SEC had previously referred ABCNews.com to its Thursday press release in which New York Associate Director for Enforcement, Andrew Calamari said, ""Our complaint alleges a stunning fraud that appears to be of epic proportions.""
According to an SEC document filed in January 2008, and cited in the complaint, Madoff's firm had between 11 and 25 clients for the fiscal year ending October 2007, and managed about $17 billion in assets in 23 different accounts.
Madoff's lawyer, Dan Horwitz, a partner at Dickstein Shapiro in New York, said his client is cooperating fully with the federal investigation.
""Bernie Madoff is a long-standing leader in the financial services industry and he is cooperating fully with the government investigation into this unfortunate set of events,"" Horwitz said.
Bernard Madoff Investment Securities, in addition to that private client practice, is also a market maker that trades with other dealers in bonds, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, according to Bloomberg News.
The firm was the 23rd largest market maker on NASDAQ in October, handling a daily average of about 50 million shares. The firm specialized in handling orders from online brokers in some of the largest U.S. companies, including General Electric Co. and Citigroup Inc., Bloomberg News reported.
But on Wednesday, Madoff allegedly told senior employees at his firm that his entire business was a fraud. According to the federal complaint, Madoff told those employees that he was ""finished"" and that ""it's all one big lie."" Madoff estimated ""the losses from the fraud to be at least approximately $50 billion,"" the complaint states.
Madoff Turned in By His Sons
At that time, Madoff also told those employees that he intended to surrender to authorities, but before he did, he planned to use $200-300 million he had left to make payments to ""selected employees, family and friends,"" the complaint states.
Madoff was arrested Thursday morning by FBI agents and charged with criminal securities fraud by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. The complaint states that he used ""manipulative and deceptive practices."" The complaint cites two senior employees describing how Madoff kept his client records ""under lock and key"" and how he left them in the dark about how he managed the private client funds. One of those employees, in interviews with the FBI, said that Madoff was ""cryptic"" in his statements. This, according to clients, is in keeping with the aura that Madoff cultivated among his clients, some of whom have kept funds under management with him for generations. ABC News has learned that the two senior employees who reported Madoff were his sons.
But by the first week of December, when clients began clamoring for redemptions -- to the tune of $7 billion -- the complaint states that Madoff began a struggle to obtain the necessary liquidity. The stress began to show, employees said.
In a meeting at their boss's Manhattan apartment -- held there following a confrontation in the office Wednesday because Madoff wasn't sure ""he would be able to hold it together"" if the conversation took place in the office -- the employees came away believing that Madoff was ""saying, in substance that he had, for years, been paying returns to certain investors out of the principal received from other, different investors.""
The next day, Dec. 11, Madoff spoke with FBI agent Theodore Cacioppi and invited the agent and another agent to his apartment. Cacioppi stated in the complaint that he told Madoff he came by to see if ""there's an innocent explanation.""
""There is no innocent explanation,"" Madoff replied, according to the sworn complaint.
Madoff started his business in 1960 with $5,000 in savings. He resides in New York City and, according to clients, also maintains a posh waterfront home. Known to his clients as Bernie, he has a long and significant history on Wall Street and has been a chairman of the board of NASDAQ and was a founding member of the board of the International Securities Clearing Corp. in London.
Madoff Released on $10 Million Bond
Madoff was also the treasurer of the board of trustees at Yeshiva University, but resigned following Thursday's announcement.
""We are shocked at this revelation,"" said a university spokesperson. ""Bernard Madoff has tendered his resignation from all positions affiliated with the university and involvement with the university. Our lawyers and accountants are investigating all aspects of his relationship to Yeshiva University. We reserve our comments until we complete our investigation.""
The Web site for Madoff's firm, in its company profile, says, ""Clients know that Bernard Madoff has a personal interest in maintaining the unblemished record of value, fair-dealing, and high ethical standards that has always been the firm's hallmark.""
Madoff was released on $10 million bond following a court appearance in Manhattan."

LE SCAN SPORT - Récidiviste, l'international français a été flashé par un radar mobile à une vitesse excessive, à proximité de Madrid.
Publicité
Karim Benzema a de nouveaux soucis avec la justice espagnole. Le buteur du Real Madrid a été entendu mardi par un juge d'Alcobendas, une ville proche de la capitale espagnole, en raison d'un présumé «crime contre la sécurité routière», rapporte la presse ibérique. L'ancienne star de l'Olympique Lyonnais a été flashée par un radar mobile au cours des dernières semaines. A sa sortie du tribunal, Karim Benzema n'a pas souhaité s'exprimer sur la nature exacte de l'infraction.
Récidiviste
Déjà en 2013, l'attaquant madrilène avait été contrôlé à 216 km/h sur une voie limité à 100 km/h. Karim Benzema avait alors écopé d'une amende de 36.000 euros accompagnée d'une suspension de permis d'une durée de huit mois. En 2011, l'international français avait également été sanctionné pour «conduite imprudente» à Ibiza. L'année de son arrivée à Madrid, en 2009, Karim Benzema a connu deux accidents sans gravité. Un dans la capitale espagnole et l'autre sur l'île de la Réunion, avec une Lamborghini.
Aujourd'hui, l'attaquant français possède une Bugatti Veyron d'une valeur d'environ deux millions d'euros. Considérée comme la voiture de série la plus rapide au monde, le bolide du constructeur français possède un moteur de 1200 chevaux et peut dépasser les 400km/h."

Football - Affaire de la sex-tape Son contrôle judiciaire levé, Karim Benzema bientôt de retour sur les lieux du crime ?
La levée ce vendredi du contrôle judiciaire va faciliter les desseins de la FFF, qui veut récupérer Benzema pour l’Euro. On devrait revoir le Madrilène à Clairefontaine.

Nancy. Non, le football n’est pas au-dessus des lois. Il est hors de question d’émettre - évidemment - le moindre doute sur l’indépendance de la justice française. Mais le fait est que la levée, ce vendredi, du contrôle judiciaire de Karim Benzema dans l’affaire de chantage à la sexe-tape, tombe à pic pour la FFF. À court terme, revoilà l’attaquant vedette sélectionnable et, donc, de nouveau en route pour l’Euro.
Didier Deschamps a donc les mains libres. Si on veut bien oublier un instant tous les multiples effets collatéraux de ce nouvel épisode dans cette histoire sordide, cela ressemble à une bonne nouvelle pour l’équipe de France. À mettre toutefois à l’épreuve des faits. Suivant le juge, le scandale pourrait faire plouf en correctionnelle, ou même avec un non-lieu. En attendant mieux, Benzema ne peut toujours pas avoir de relations avec les autres suspects, notamment ses amis d’enfance à l’origine du chantage.
Le reste est un simple compte à rebours destiné à habiller chaudement l’évidence. L’entreprise de communication de la FFF a commencé vendredi, la voilà ouvertement aux manettes pour théâtraliser la réconciliation publique avec Valbuena. L’idée étant d’associer les deux internationaux dans un casting de victimes !
Comment va réagir le public français ?
Le sélectionneur a laissé entendre il y a quelques jours que le Lyonnais avait perdu pied sportivement en raison précisément de cette brouille. Il lui appartiendra, dans sa prochaine liste, de lever une partie du voile sur ses intentions : Benzema avec Valbuena, l’un sans l’autre ou… personne. Le premier est son attaquant leader, le second son choix numéro un si l’on se fie aux listes précédentes. Des commentaires de gestion de crise seront exigés pour continuer à rebrousser chemin.
Plusieurs questions de moindre importance demeurent en suspens. La posture de Valbuena, alors qu’on dit que sa manière d’avoir rendu l’affaire publique n’a pas plu en hauts lieux. Le tribunal populaire, autre juge de paix : comment va réagir le public français ?
On peut faire confiance à l’usure du temps pour amortir les chocs, mais aussi aux avocats du Madrilène, Zidane, Jamel Debbouze ou encore Noël Le Graët, etc ! Tous ont des intérêts particuliers dans la résolution de cette cause nationale, histoire d’éloigner le plus possible le sujet tabou de l’intégration. Un championnat d’Europe en France devait servir à apaiser les tensions de cette nature, il serait insupportable qu’il les crée.

Celebrated Wall Street trader arrested over $50bn con
Bernie Madoff, a former chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange has been accused    of potentially the biggest fraud in corporate history.

By Tom Leonard and James Quinn in New York
5:29PM GMT 12 Dec 2008
Even by the standards of New York's recent financial turmoil, the charges levelled at Bernard Madoff are eye-watering – a $50 billion (£33.5 billion) swindle perpetrated by one of the most celebrated traders on Wall Street.
Mr Madoff, 70, a former chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange and a supposed pillar of the financial community, has been accused of defrauding hedge funds of billions with a fake investment scheme called a 'Ponzi'.
In the fraud outlined by the government, Mr Madoff allegedly promised huge returns to early investors in his asset management business, only to lose their money on the markets. He then paid them back with money put in by later investors, rather than from revenues generated by any real share trading, prosecutors claim.
The news has rocked the hedge fund world as investors faced losing all their money in a scam that, if confirmed, would have what one expert described as a ""monumental impact"" on the $1.6 trillion (£1 trillion) industry.
Prosecutors say Mr Madoff ran his fraudulent operation for years secretly from a separate floor of the Manhattan offices of his trading firm, Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities, keeping its financial statements ""under lock and key"".

They believe his scheme unravelled earlier this month after clients – who include hedge funds, banks and wealthy individuals – wanted to redeem some $7 billion (£4.7 billion) and Mr Madoff realised he could not find the money.
In a criminal complaint filed by the FBI and the US Attorney's office, Mr Madoff allegedly told colleagues earlier this week that his investment advisory business was ""all just one big lie"" and that his firm was ""basically, a giant Ponzi scheme"".
He said he was ""finished"" and resigned to going to prison, say prosecutors who arrested him on Thursday after – according to the Wall Street Journal – he was turned in by his two grown-up sons.
Mr Madoff has been charged with a single count of securities fraud and faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5 million (£3.3 million).
He also faces a separate civil lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission which accuses him of defrauding his clients in an ongoing $50 billion (£33.5 billion) fraud.
""Our complaint alleges a stunning fraud that appears to be of epic proportions,"" said Andrew Calamari, the associate director of enforcement at the SEC's New York office.
According to the SEC's complaint, Mr Madoff told an FBI agent there was ""no innocent explanation"" and that it was his fault that he had ""paid investors with money that wasn't there"".
Mr Madoff has been released on $10 million (£7 million) bail, said his lawyers.
""Bernie Madoff is a long-standing leader in the financial services industry. He will fight to get through this unfortunate set of events,"" said Daniel Horwitz, one of his lawyers.
Christopher Miller, chief executive of Allenbridge Hedgeinfo, a hedge fund ratings agency in London, told the Wall Street Journal that ""some very big investor names are involved in this"" and said it would have a ""monumental impact for the hedge fund industry"".
He blamed the ""credulousness"" of investors who failed to question how they got such big returns on their investments and predicted the case – if proved – was likely to lead to tighter regulation.
Mr Madoff founded the investment firm that stills bears his name in 1960 with $5,000 (£3,000) he earned working as a beach lifeguard on Long Island.
Joined later by his brother, Peter, they took advantage of American moves to increase stock market competition and built their firm into a business that last month was managing some $17 billion (£11 billion) in assets.
The firm's website boasts how clients know that Mr Madoff ""has a personal interest in maintaining an unblemished record of value, fair dealing and high ethical standards"".
Madoff Securities International Ltd, a London-based business in which Mr Madoff was a major shareholder, stressed yesterday that its business activities were not involved with the American asset management firm under investigation.

43,"Veterans officer sentenced to probation, fine on theft charge
By news@wctrib.com on Oct 3, 2008  at 12:00 a.m.
WILLMAR -- The Kandiyohi County veterans service officer was sentenced Thursday to five years of probation, a $1,000 fine and a host of conditions on a felony theft charge for taking money veterans paid for bus rides to the Veteran Affairs hospital.
Trisha Lynn Appeldorn, 34, of Pennock, received a stay of adjudication on her sentence, handed down by Judge Kathryn N. Smith in Kandiyohi County District Court. Under the stay, no conviction will appear on Appeldorn's record if she complies with the court's conditions.
Before she was sentenced, Appeldorn said she is taking steps to be a better wife, mother and person.
She acknowledged her actions disappointed her employer and family.
""Through all of this I have let a lot of people down,"" she said.
Conditions set by Smith include that Appeldorn pay $214 in restitution, complete a chemical use assessment and follow all recommendations, not use alcohol or drugs and submit to random testing.
She must also take prescription medications as prescribed, follow the aftercare recommendations of Project Turnabout's Vanguard gambling program, not enter bars that have pull tab gambling unless for her work and approved by probation, attend Gamblers Anonymous and continuing meetings for the Vanguard program and serve 30 days of electronic alcohol monitoring starting Dec. 10.
Court records show that Appeldorn paid the $214 in restitution, the $1,000 fine and $87 in court fees on Thursday.
Tom Anderson, Appeldorn's attorney, argued that his client deserved leniency and support from the community and that she, her family and employer have been put under great strain by newspaper reports of the charges and court proceedings.
""She is a tremendous asset to the community,"" Anderson said, noting that since Appeldorn started working as the veterans service officer, enrollment by county veterans in health, disability and pension programs has increased greatly. ""She knows the challenges veterans face in this county. That's why she has served them so well.""
Appeldorn, he noted, was serving in the Air Force overseas when she was injured in an auto crash.
Rich Ronning, the Willmar city attorney who has been named a special assistant county attorney to prosecute the case, urged that Appeldorn had violated conditions of release by using alcohol and expressed concern that she hasn't been honest with officials about her alcohol use.
""She will not get through this if she is not being honest,"" he said, pressing the court to impose electronic alcohol monitoring on Appeldorn.
Appeldorn had been placed on paid administrative leave from her county post, but was allowed to go back to her job in April. Kandiyohi County Administrator Larry Kleindl has said an internal investigation would be delayed until the court process was completed.
The theft charge was filed Feb. 11 after a Willmar Police Department detective met Jan. 25 with Kleindl regarding missing funds from the veterans service office. Kleindl explained that veterans pay $10 per trip, given to the bus driver, to ride a county bus to the VA hospital. The bus driver in turn would give the cash and checks to the veterans service office on a daily basis. Then the funds would be turned over to the county auditor for deposit.
Kleindl had been advised that there had been no deposits since June 2007 and told the detective that Appeldorn had showed up in his office that morning of Jan. 25 with a big wad of cash.
The detective met with both Kleindl and Appeldorn later the same day. Appeldorn explained that she had simply been putting the envelopes with the bus receipts in a drawer and that she didn't get around to making up the deposits and taking them to the auditor's office.
She further explained that she had taken the materials home the night before and got everything together and then brought the money into Kleindl's office.
On Jan. 28, the detective was informed by County Auditor Sam Modderman that the $2,284 that had been turned in was $214 short of the $2,498 in receipts issued by the bus driver.
On Jan. 30, the detective met with Appeldorn, who admitted that she had taken small amounts of money from the bus receipts and that the total must have been around $200."

Et si Karim Benzema, mis en examen pour tentative de chantage ou complicité et participation à une association de malfaiteurs dans l'affaire de tentative de chantage à la sextape contre Mathieu Valbuena, obtenait justement un coup de pouce de la justice française?
Tout comme un autre des protagonistes du dossier, Karim Zenati, un ami d’enfance de Benzema, l'attaquant du Real Madrid contestera devant la Cour de cassation la validité de l'enquête, estimant que le policier avait utilisé des méthodes pousse-au-crime.
L'avocat général pour la validité de la procédure
L’affaire avait débuté en juin 2015, lorsque Mathieu Valbuena avait reçu un appel d'un maître chanteur inconnu, affirmant détenir une vidéo intime le concernant. Le corbeau proposait au milieu offensif transféré il y a quelques jours à Fenerbahçe de trouver un arrangement, sans évoquer le montant à payer, conduisant l’international français à déposer plainte.
Une négociation avait commencé entre un policier, se faisant passer pour un proche de ""Petit vélo"", et l’escroc, nourrie d’appels téléphoniques répétés, certains à l’initiative de l’enquêteur. C’est ce procédé jugé déloyal qui est mis en cause.
Dans son avis avant l’audience, l’avocat général a toutefois préconisé le rejet du pourvoi et donc pour la validation de la procédure, selon une source proche du dossier.
Les ""cerveaux"" présumés du chantage identifiés
Un mois plus tôt, Djibril Cissé avait fait part à Valbuena de «murmures», en évoquant l’existence de cette vidéo supposément compromettante. Il a été mis en examen fin février.
La justice cherche notamment à savoir dans quelles conditions Djibril Cissé a pris connaissance de la vidéo incriminée, à savoir si il l’a seulement visionnée ou s’il l’a téléchargée sur son téléphone portable.
L’enquête avait permis d’identifier les ""cerveaux"" présumés de l’entreprise de chantage, Mustapha Zouaoui et Axel Angot, qui gravitent depuis des années autour des footballeurs, ainsi que le corbeau présumé, Younès Houass.
Zouaoui et Angot s’étaient ensuite tournés vers Karim Zenati, un ami d’enfance de Benzema, afin que l’attaquant du Real Madrid pousse Valbuena à payer. Ils ont été mis en examen pour tentative de chantage ou complicité et participation à une association de malfaiteurs.

Daimler, BMW und Volkswagen geben alle vom ADAC in den vergangenen Jahren vergebenen „Gelben Engel“ zurück. Dies kündigten die Autohersteller am Montag an, nachdem die Wirtschaftsprüfung Deloitte festgestellt hat, dass sowohl die Stimmenzahl als auch die Platzierung der Preisträger 2014 durch den Automobilclub manipuliert wurde.
Die Autohersteller hatten in der vergangenen Woche die Rückgabe bereits angedroht für den Fall, dass sich der Verdacht weitgehender Manipulationen bei der Wahl zum „Lieblingsauto der Deutschen“ bestätigen sollte.

Schwere Manipulationsvorwürfe gegen VW: Konzernchef Martin Winterkorn verspricht Aufklärung.

Volkswagen hat massive Abgas-Manipulationen in den USA zugegeben, die den Autobauer eine Milliarden-Strafe einbringen könnte. Ein Firmensprecher sagte: ""Wir haben das gegenüber der Behörde eingeräumt. Der Sachverhalt trifft zu. Wir arbeiten aktiv mit der Behörde zusammen."" Konzert-Chef
Martin Winterkorn kündigte eine umfassende Aufklärung des Abgas-Skandals an. ""Ich persönlich bedauere zutiefst, dass wir das Vertrauen unserer Kunden und der Öffentlichkeit enttäuscht haben"", teilte Winterkorn in Wolfsburg mit. ""Die Geschehnisse haben für uns im Vorstand und für mich ganz persönlich höchste Priorität."" 
VW habe eine externe Untersuchung in Auftrag gegeben. ""Klar ist: Volkswagen duldet keine Regel- oder Gesetzesverstöße jedweder Art"", sagte Winterkorn. Volkswagen werde alles daran setzen, Vertrauen, wiederzugewinnen. ""Wir arbeiten mit den zuständigen Behörden offen und umfassend zusammen, um den Sachverhalt schnell und transparent vollumfänglich zu klären"", sagte der Konzernchef. 
Die US-Umweltbehörde  EPA  beschuldigt gegen das Klimaschutzgesetz ""Clean Air Act"" verstoßen zu haben. Der Konzern soll mit Hilfe einer Software die Resultate von Abgasuntersuchungen geschönt haben. VW drohen schlimmstenfalls Strafzahlungen von mehr als 18 Milliarden Dollar und ein noch nicht abzuschätzender Imageschaden.

Experte fordert Überprüfung in Europa
Autoexperte Ferdinand Dudenhöffer fordert nun auch, die Praxis von Abgastests in Europa zu untersuchen. ""Sicherlich müssen jetzt auch die EU-Kommission und das Bundesverkehrsministerium den Dingen nachgehen und klären, inwieweit diese Software auch in Europa und Deutschland eingesetzt wurde und falsche Abgaswerte vorgaukelt"", sagte Dudenhöffer den Zeitungen der Funke Mediengruppe (""Berliner Morgenpost"", ""Hamburger Abendblatt"", ""Westdeutsche Allgemeine""). 
Daimler-Chef Dieter Zetsche sagte am Sonntag bei einer Veranstaltung der Wochenzeitung ""Die Zeit"", es sei zu früh, um die Sache zu bewerten. ""Ich weiß viel zu wenig über den Fall, um zunächst mal beurteilen zu können, wie gerechtfertigt der Vorwurf Volkswagen gegenüber ist und ob wir zu hundert Prozent und in jeder Betrachtungsweise davor völlig sicher sein können"", sagte Zetsche.
Bedrohung für öffentliche Gesundheit
Die US-Umweltbehörde EPA wirft VW vor, die Ermittlungen von Abgaswerten bei Dieselfahrzeugen manipuliert zu haben. Betroffen sind bisher rund 482.000 Autos. Laut EPA soll das Programm ermöglichen, das Abgas-Kontrollsystem nur bei offiziellen Emissionstests zu aktivieren. Das würde bedeuten, dass die Luftverpestung im Normalbetrieb viel höher wäre. Bislang seien Fahrzeuge der Baujahre 2009 bis 2015 aufgefallen, darunter das für VW in den USA wichtigste Modell Jetta, aber auch der Golf, Beetle und der Passat und der Audi A3.
""Solche Mittel zu benutzen, um die Klimaschutzstandards zu umgehen, ist illegal und eine Bedrohung für die öffentliche Gesundheit"", hatte EPA-Vertreterin Cynthia Giles gesagt. Ihre Behörde werde die Untersuchungen in diesem ""sehr ernsten"" Fall fortsetzen. Dabei sei nicht auszuschließen, dass weitere Verdachtsfälle ans Licht kämen.
Schaden für deutsche Autoindustrie
Dudenhöffer sieht nun Volkswagen-Chef Martin Winterkorn in der Verantwortung. ""Wir haben es hier mit einer Sache zu tun, die nicht beim Pförtner endet"", sagte Dudenhöffer. Der Fall könne die gesamte deutsche Autoindustrie beschädigen.
Der Autofachmann Stefan Bratzel von der Fachhochschule der Wirtschaftin Bergisch Gladbach sagte, bei VW müsse es strukturelle Änderungen geben. ""Da ist etwas fundamental schiefgegangen bei VW"", sagte Bratzel der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. Es sei sehr verwunderlich, dass die mutmaßlichen Machenschaften der amerikanischen US-Tochter nicht längst an Wolfsburg gemeldet worden seien und das Durchgreifen der Konzernspitze nach sich gezogen hätte.
Wie andere Branchenkenner ist Bratzel entsetzt: ""Das ist ein Bärendienst für die ganze deutsche Dieseltechnologie"", sagt er. Hierdurch würde das Image von
Dieselautos - in den USA ohnehin in einer Nische - schwer beschädigt. Auch BMW und Daimler seien dadurch indirekt betroffen. ""Man versucht seit Jahren, die Dieseltechnologie zu etablieren in den USA - und jetzt das"", sagte Bratzel.
Umweltverband will Fahrverbot erreichen
Ein VW-Sprecher betonte, für den Konzern gehörten Umweltschutz und Nachhaltigkeit zu den strategischen Unternehmenszielen. ""Deshalb nimmt Volkswagen diese Vorwürfe sehr ernst und arbeitet eng und kooperativ mit der untersuchenden Behörde zusammen und veranlasst alles in seiner Macht stehende, um die Hintergründe für die erhobenen Vorwürfe gründlich aufzuklären."" 
Dem Unternehmen drohen Strafzahlungen in Milliardenhöhe, auch wenn noch völlig offen ist, ob die maximal Summe tatsächlich gezahlt werden muss. ""Das ist äußerst ernst zu nehmen"", sagte Dudenhöffer der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. Den ohnehin schlecht laufenden Geschäften der Kernmarke VW dort werde der Vorgang kaum helfen. Doch auch in Europa könnte der Skandal Folgen haben. Die Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) will angesichts der Manipulationsvorwürfe gegen VW ein Fahrverbot von Dieselautos in Deutschland erreichen. 
Das Problem bestehe nicht nur in den USA, sondern in noch deutlich stärkerem Umfang in Europa vor allem bei den deutschen Herstellern, teilte die Organisation am Samstag in Berlin mit. Die DUH will nun vor deutschen Gerichten ein Fahrverbot für Diesel-Pkw erstreiten. Die Organisation wirft Autoherstellern seit längerem vor, die Abgasbelastung durch Dieselantriebe zu schönen. Hierzulande sind rund 13,8 Millionen Autos mit Dieselantrieb unterwegs, damit liegt der Anteil an der gesamten Pkw-Flotte in Deutschland bei rund 31 Prozent.

47,"justice Football : Benzema conteste l’enquête dans l’affaire de la sextape

Karim Benzema conteste, ce mardi devant la Cour de cassation, la validité de l’enquête dans l’affaire de tentative de chantage à la sextape contre Mathieu Valbuena, dans laquelle il est mis en examen.
Mi-décembre dernier, la cour d’appel de Versailles a validé des écoutes litigieuses entre un corbeau, qui avait appelé Valbuena en affirmant détenir sa vidéo intime, et un policier sous couverture qui s’était fait passer pour l’homme de main de Valbuena. Benzema, tout comme un autre des protagonistes du dossier, Karim Zenati, un ami d’enfance de l’attaquant du Real Madrid, a formé un pourvoi en cassation, estimant que le policier avait utilisé des méthodes pousse-au-crime.
Dans son avis avant l’audience, l’avocat général préconise toutefois le rejet du pourvoi et plaide donc pour la validation de la procédure.
L’affaire avait débuté en juin 2015, lorsque Valbuena avait reçu un appel de cet inconnu. Le maître-chanteur proposait au milieu offensif de l’Olympique Lyonnais de trouver un arrangement, sans évoquer le montant à payer, conduisant l’international français à déposer plainte. Une négociation avait alors commencé entre un policier et l’escroc.
Quel rôle pour Cissé ?
Un mois plus tôt, Djibril Cissé avait fait part à Valbuena de « murmures », en évoquant l’existence de cette vidéo supposément compromettante. Il a été mis en examen fin février.
La justice cherche notamment à savoir dans quelles conditions Cissé a pris connaissance de la vidéo incriminée. Pour être clair : l’ancien international français l’a-t-il seulement visionnée ou téléchargée sur son téléphone portable ?
L’enquête avait permis d’identifier les cerveaux présumés de l’entreprise de chantage, Mustapha Zouaoui et Axel Angot, qui gravitent depuis des années autour des footballeurs, ainsi que le corbeau présumé, Younès Houass. Zouaoui et Angot s’étaient ensuite tournés vers Karim Zenati, un ami d’enfance de Benzema, afin que l’attaquant du Real Madrid pousse Valbuena à payer.
Ils ont été mis en examen pour tentative de chantage ou complicité et participation à une association de malfaiteurs.

Bernie Madoff arrested over alleged $50 billion fraud
Bernie Madoff, a former chairman of the NASDAQ stock market, has been arrested    and charged with running a multi-billion dollar hedge fund swindle in New    York.

1:24PM GMT 12 Dec 2008
Mr Madoff is alleged to have operated the scheme through his hedge fund business, which was separate from his better-known market-making business, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (BMIS).
Mr Madoff told senior employees of his firm on Wednesday that ""it's all just one big lie"" and that he was ""finished"", according to a criminal complaint filed on Thursday night by the US Attorney's office and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI).
He allegedly went on to say that the business was ""a giant Ponzi scheme"" – a reference to Charles Ponzi, one of the greatest swindlers in US history – and estimated that the scheme had lost investors $50bn over many years – which would make the hedge fund one of the biggest frauds in history.
""There is no innocent explanation,"" Mr Madoff said, according to the criminal complaint. He told the agents that it was all his fault, and that he ""paid investors with money that wasn't there"", according to the complaint.
He allegedly told his employees that he had, for years, been paying returns to certain investors out of the cash received from other investors.

Analysis: Alleged $50bn fraud may be just a foretaste of what's to come
12 Dec 2008
Mr Madoff, 70, was charged with a single count of securities fraud and faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $5m if found guilty.
The criminal complaint was accompanied by a separate civil lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which accuses Mr Madoff of defrauding clients of his firm and seeks emergency relief for the victims.
""Our complaint alleges a stunning fraud – both in terms of scope and duration. We are moving quickly and decisively to stop the scheme and protect the remaining assets for investors,"" said Scott Friestad, the SEC's deputy enforcer.
The complaint details that as of Jan 7, 2008, Madoff's investment advisory business had assets of $17.1bn, serving up to 25 clients.
Although Mr Madoff is thought to have few direct British links, he did open a London office in 1983, with Madoff Securities International becoming one of the first American members of the London Stock Exchange.
Stephen Raven, chief executive of Madoff Securities International said: “We only became aware overnight of the news relating to our Chairman, Bernard Madoff. Our business in London is not in any way part of Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities LLC. His major shareholding in our firm is a personal investment. Our business activities are not involved in any way with the US asset management company with which the reported allegations appear to be concerned. We do not have any further information beyond what is already in the public domain.""
In 2000, his market-making business BMIS partnered with Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch to the form the new Primex Trading platform, one of the early rival electronic exchanges to the main bourses which eventually fell by the wayside following a partnership with NASDAQ.
BMIS is also credited with ending the old practice of quoting New York Stock Exchange-listed securities in eighths of a dollar in 1997, instead listing them in sixteenths.
Mr Madoff began BMIS with just $5,000 of savings from jobs lifeguarding at Rockaway Beach and installing sprinkler systems.
The firm grew to become a leading market maker, with brother Peter, nephew Charles, niece Shana, and sons Mark and Andrew all involved in the business at some stage in recent years.
His firm's website claims that BMIS ranks among the top one per cent of US securities firms, and states that ""clients know Bernard Madoff has a personal interest in maintaining... high ethical standards.""
Mr Madoff's lawyer, Dan Horwitz, called his client ""a person of integrity"" and said he intends to fight the charge. ""We will fight to get through this unfortunate set of events."" His client was released on a $10m bond secured by his New York apartment.

Spielberg Among the Big Names Allegedly Burned by Madoff in $50 Billion Fraud Case
By Bianna Golodryga
Email
Director Steven Spielberg is only one of many prominent investors who were allegedly swindled by one of Wall Street's biggest money managers, Bernard Madoff .
Publishing and real estate magnate Mort Zuckerman, former New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg and Fred Wilpon, the owner of the New York Mets baseball franchise , are also among those who were reportedly burned in what prosecutors call a massive Ponzi scheme that was revealed after the collapse of Bernard Madoff Investment Securities, according to The Wall Street Journal. Losses from the alleged fraud could reach $50 billion .

null
Spielberg's charity, the Wunderkinder Foundation, invested nearly 70 percent of its money with Madoff, said The Wall Street Journal. Other charitable organizations that invested with Madoff may have to shut their doors.
And average investors like Arnold and Joan Sinkin said they were stunned when they learned ""in one telephone call"" that their retirement fund had vanished.
The Sinkins had saved close to $1 million during Arnold Sinkin's 54-year career as a carpet salesman, and all their money was managed by Madoff.
""This is what they refer to as the golden years, where you retire, you try to enjoy life. And then you get wiped out in 48 hours,"" Sinkin, 76, said.
Play
null
The Sinkins said they have no choice but to sell their dream home. ""Everything we planned for our whole lives is gone. We just don't know where to turn. Who's gonna help us?"" asked Sinkin.
How Did It Happen?
The Sinkins and other investors wonder how Madoff was able to get away with the fraud for so long, and industry experts ask whether the Securities and Exchange Commission was asleep at the wheel.
Securities executive Harry Markopolos raised an alarm in 1999 when he warned the SEC it should investigate Madoff because he thought it was impossible for the kind of profit Madoff was making to have been gained legally.
Financial industry experts said that one bad trade could have set the entire scheme into motion. When that may have happened, however, is unclear.
""Most of these Ponzi schemes, so-called Ponzi schemes, start out with an honest investment firm and honest intentions, and for whatever reason, a trade gone bad, you start to rob from Peter to pay Paul until Peter's no longer available and it starts to feed on itself. That's what essentially is the speculation of what happened. The timing of when that actually kicked into gear, we don't know yet,"" Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said.
Madoff Attracted Big Name Investors
With an extraordinary track record and a charismatic personality, Madoff easily attracted big investors .
""As a broker dealer, Bernie Madoff is a tremendously warm, nice, caring, thoughtful, attractive person, and I think that seduced many people,"" said Jim Vos, the CEO of Aksia, an independent hedge fund research and advisory firm.
Madoff's firm was the subject of two investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2005 and 2007. The first investigation found him to be in violation of trading rules, but the case was later dropped.
""I have to imagine there is a level of incompetence, sadly, at the SEC on this,"" Andrew Ross Sorkin, the chief mergers and acquisitions reporter for The New York Times said. ""I think maybe this was a trade that's gone bad or something else. But to think this took place this long and the regulators missing it every time? That's an even sadder story.""
SEC officials stress that it was Madoff's separate and secretive investment-adviser business that was used to perpetrate the alleged scheme, and that examinations of the securities operations wouldn't necessarily have detected irregularities. The hedge fund business didn't register with the SEC until September 2006.
Investor Warren Buffett has said, ""Only when the tide goes out that you learn who has been swimming naked.""
Mellody Hobson, ""Good Morning America's"" financial contributor and president of Arial Capital Management, said more problems within the industry may come to light.
""What worries me is that in this kind of environment, where there have been significant losses in the market is that people start to stretch,"" she said. ""They get more aggressive because they're desperate to dig out of the holes they are in, and they may do some things that actually make the situation worse.""

51,"Death penalty possible in Vermont sex-kidnap
By:          AP
> Be the first person to share your comment
BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) _ Federal prosecutors have filed kidnapping charges that carry the death penalty against a Vermont man whose 12-year-old niece was found dead near his home.
Authorities accused Michael Jacques, 42, of carefully orchestrating events and e-mails to make it appear that Brooke Bennett had gone on June 25 to see someone she had met online, according to an affidavit accompanying the charges.
Citing statements from another underage girl, prosecutors claim that Jacques tricked Brooke into thinking she was going to a party and instead took her to his home to initiate her into a child sex ring.
Michael Desautels, the federal public defender representing Jacques, did not return calls Thursday morning.
E-mails quoted in an affidavit released Thursday accuse Jacques of coercing or enlisting the second girl to participate.
The girl wrote, ""yes. I will help,"" one e-mail said.
Jacques is charged under a federal law that provides for the death penalty in a kidnapping resulting in a child's death. Jacques has 1993 convictions for kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault.
With autopsy results still pending, prosecutors said they could not say that Brooke was murdered. If she was, U.S. Attorney Tom Anderson was asked if he would seek the death penalty.
""That determination would be made after the investigation is completed, after the case is presented to a grand jury and, ultimately, that decision is made by the attorney general of the United States of America,"" Anderson said.
Meantime, state charges alleging that Jacques sexually assaulted a different girl over a five-year period were dropped, but could be refiled.
Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell said there is plenty of work ahead ""both in terms of investigation and prosecution.""
In the affidavits, authorities accused Jacques of making a MySpace posting, purportedly from Brooke, indicating that she planned a rendezvous on June 25 with someone she had met online.

52,"VW-Aktionï¿½re wollen von der Konzernspitze Antworten
Von        dpa
Vorlesen
Berlin (dpa) - Der weltgrï¿½ï¿½te Autobauer Volkswagen steht weiter unter Beschuss von vielen Seiten. Heute muss Vorstandschef Herbert Diess nach gut einem Jahr an der Konzernspitze den Aktionï¿½ren in Berlin Rede und Antwort stehen.
Noch immer haben Ermittlungen und Rechtsverfahren die Wolfsburger fest im Griff, erst jï¿½ngst stieg mit neuen Milliardenkosten die Rechnung fï¿½r den im September 2015 aufgeflogenen Dieselskandal auf 30 Milliarden Euro.
Diess sucht inmitten der groï¿½en Umwï¿½lzung in der Branche die Flucht nach vorn: Er forciert auch gegen Widerstï¿½nde in der deutschen Autoindustrie den reinen Elektroantrieb als Kï¿½nigsweg zur Senkung klimaschï¿½dlicher Abgase. Dafï¿½r steckt Volkswagen Milliarden in Batterien, Antriebe und neue Modelle. Wie Volkswagen am Montagabend mitteilte, stecken die Wolfsburger nun auch als erster deutsche Hersteller knapp eine Milliarde Euro in den Aufbau einer Batteriezellfertigung.
In einigen Konzernteilen will Diess zudem mehr Rendite sehen und hat einen strikteren Sparkurs angeordnet - so etwa in der Kernmarke VW und bei Audi. Die Plï¿½ne, bei VW Pkw Tausende Stellen zu streichen, haben jedoch auf Arbeitnehmerseite deutliche Kritik heraufbeschworen. Die Lkw-Sparte Traton soll nun doch noch vor der Sommerpause an die Bï¿½rse gebracht werden, nachdem der Konzern vor rund zwei Monaten noch einen Rï¿½ckzieher machte. Bei weiteren Unternehmensteilen wird geprï¿½ft, was VW mit ihnen kï¿½nftig anstellen will.
In der Dieselaffï¿½re bleibt die Frage, was Konzernvorstï¿½nde von der Manipulation der Abgastests wussten. Zuletzt klagte die Staatsanwaltschaft Braunschweig den langjï¿½hrigen Konzernchef Martin Winterkorn und weitere Fï¿½hrungskrï¿½fte wegen schweren Betrugs an. Vergangenes Jahr verlor der damalige Audi-Chef und VW-Konzernvorstand Rupert Stadler seinen Job. Er war im Juni 2018 verhaftet worden und erst nach Monaten wieder freigekommen. Die Mï¿½nchener Justiz verdï¿½chtigt ihn des Betrugs. Der Konzern will Stadler wegen der laufenden Untersuchungen zunï¿½chst auch nicht von den Aktionï¿½ren entlasten lassen.
Angesichts der derzeitigen Branchenflaute steht VW mit seinen Geschï¿½ftszahlen zwar vergleichsweise ordentlich da. Trotzdem dï¿½rften VW-Aktionï¿½re mit Kritik nicht sparen: Rund 60.000 Einzelklagen wegen Diesel sind in Deutschland gegen den Konzern anhï¿½ngig, Anleger werfen der Konzernspitze in einem milliardenschweren Verfahren eine zu spï¿½te Information zu den Ausmaï¿½en des Skandals vor. Die vor drei Jahren eingefrorenen Boni fï¿½r damalige Vorstandsmitglieder zahlt der Konzern in diesem Mai aus, weil der Aktienkurs sich erholt hatte.
Ob sich die Kritik auch in den Abstimmungsergebnissen niederschlï¿½gt, bleibt fraglich. Die Macht im Konzern ist klar aufseiten der Eigentï¿½merfamilie Porsche-Piech verteilt, die ï¿½ber die Porsche-Holding mehr als die Hï¿½lfte der VW-Stimmrechte kontrolliert. Das Land Niedersachsen hï¿½lt weitere 20 Prozent der Stimmrechte, das Emirat Katar 17 Prozent. Die Anteilseigner der im Dax gelisteten Vorzugsaktie haben kein Stimmrecht."

Just outside the new entrance, crews are chipping and chopping away to disassemble the old Interstate 40 bridges piece by piece. Inside, crews rush to complete the 86,241-square-foot addition that will include the mezzanine, a rooftop patio and expanded restaurant space — all before the Oklahoma City Thunder’s first tip-off this fall.
Space for the Thunder’s corporate offices should be completed and occupied later this year, as part of the final phase.
The arena’s renovation is funded by a 1-cent sales tax overwhelmingly approved by Oklahoma City voters in 2008. That tax, which ran for 15 months, was expected to raise $121.6 million; however, the nationwide economic downturn resulted in collections falling short of initial estimates.
When all is said and done, total revenues will be $114.2 million, said Tom Anderson, executive manager of special projects for the city.
Of that, the arena will receive $94 million, a decrease from the initial $101 million estimate. An off-site team practice facility will receive $18.2 million that originally had been set for about $20 million.
When it was clear that initial financial expectations wouldn’t be met, the city went back to the drawing board, reconfiguring office space and scrapping a warm-up court that would sit over a loading dock.
“These two things enabled the project to be completed to the high level of quality everyone was anticipating without affecting patron amenities,” Anderson said.
What’s new
Entering the arena, fans will pass through what was previously the back wall, and into a spacious area leading to the bowl.
That area will open to the newly expanded Jack Daniels Old No. 7 restaurant and bar, and the new Courtside Cafe. In a Kids Zone, children and parents can shoot hoops and play arcade games or pose with a cutout of Rumble, the Thunder’s mascot.
Work continues on the arena.

From new carpeting and colored terrazzo floors, to television screens throughout the perimeter of the bowl on all levels, additions will help ensure that even the thriftiest ticket buyer won’t feel like a chump. Whether a ticket costs $10 or $1,000, all levels will boast restrooms with porcelain tile and granite countertops.
“The restrooms are just as nice on the 300 level as they are on the 100 level,” Anderson said. “There’s equity on all levels when it comes to amenities.”
While the entrance currently faces a field of weeds and rundown buildings, that perspective will be changing, too. When the bridges come down, plans are in the works for a federally funded $80 million boulevard as part of the I-40 relocation. The southwest entrance will overlook a planned 70-acre park funded by MAPS 3 tax collections.
“As Oklahoma City develops with the new park and boulevard, the new entrance will get utilized and help us in building operations with patron flow and ingress and egress,” Anderson said.
Still evolving
Gary Desjardins, manager of the arena, said the facility has advanced by leaps and bounds since opening in 2002. Part of the first MAPS project, it was built for $89 million and to minimum NBA standards at the time. It included things like darkrooms for sports photographers.
“Between the time it was designed and the time it opened, the technology had already changed,” Desjardins said. “That is going to constantly evolve.”

The Thunder offices will move from Leadership Square to 30,000 square feet on two floors in the new addition.
Spokesman Dan Mahoney said the team has worked closely throughout the renovation process with the city and SMG, which manages the arena.
“We’re in the home stretch for renovations, and that new entrance will be beautiful and a whole new experience for our fans coming into the building,” he said. “It just all adds to what is already a great building.”

FOR ANYONE taking stock of 2008, Barack Obama is the inevitable choice as Person of the Year. But he’s not the only American whose story suggests that this thrilling, dramatic, unforgettable year will be seen as a demarcation of grand historical eras, a bright line between yesterday and tomorrow. My choice for runner-up is Bernard Madoff.
In a sense, we’re all Bernie Madoff. We’ve been running our economy in accordance with his accounting principles for a generation — and now we face a most unpleasant reckoning.
As everyone knows by now, Madoff — once one of the most respected financiers on Wall Street — stands accused of being perhaps the biggest swindler in history. Before his arrest earlier this month, he reportedly told his sons that he had defrauded investors of up to $50 billion. He allegedly followed the playbook written more than eight decades ago by the elegant grifter Charles Ponzi, who used money from new investors to pay juicy returns to old investors. That works fine for a while, but every Ponzi scheme eventually collapses in ruin.
Wall Street veterans recall how investors once begged to be allowed to invest their money with Madoff. Unlike Ponzi, he didn’t promise to deliver flashy double-digit returns overnight. He “earned” his investors 1 percent or 2 percent a month, bull market or bear, rain or shine. Because he didn’t overpromise, and because he limited his clientele, he was able to keep it going for decades.
Such steady gains, unsullied by the occasional bad year or disastrous quarter, are patently impossible. Some potential investors took one look at Madoff’s operation and took a pass. Some of the millionaires, billionaires and professional money managers who unwisely gave their money to Madoff were guilty of allowing greed to overwhelm their powers of observation and reason.
But not all of Madoff’s investors could have been in the dark. At least some must have realized how unlikely it was that he had developed some sort of Holy Grail strategy or technique that would always make money, no matter what the financial markets were doing. Some investors, I would wager, must have calculated that they could get in, get their return and get out before the whole thing fell apart.
Which makes me wonder how many of us had our eyes open when housing prices were soaring in Ponzi-like increments — by 10 percent or more a year, in some parts of the country — while middle-class incomes were largely stagnant. How many of us stopped to ask just who was supposed to be able to pay $1 million for a standard suburban split-level, even if it had an upgraded kitchen with a Sub-Zero fridge?
The whole subprime mortgage industry was based on the idea that housing prices would always rise. Given that assumption, it was perfectly rational for first-time homebuyers to sign up for adjustable-rate mortgages that they couldn’t really afford. From the moment they signed the loan papers, they would be building equity — through appreciation — that soon would make it easy, and lucrative, to refinance or sell.
In other words: get in, get their return and get out before the whole thing fell apart.
I’m not saying that average Americans were as culpable as Wall Street in creating this financial and economic crisis; our sins were venial, whereas theirs were mortal. Madoff’s alleged fraud was at least straightforward. Much worse was the creation of exotic “derivative” investment products that were bought and sold with enormous leverage — products whose true value turned out to be impossible to ascertain. As long as real estate values kept rising, it didn’t matter what these chimerical investments were worth. What mattered to Wall Street was the ability to collect enormous fees from real people, in real dollars, for trading unicorns and dragons.
After the bursting of the Internet bubble and the housing bubble, I think we’re done with bubbles for a while. Obama’s first challenge — and it may take much of his first term — is to get the economy back into a pattern of tangible, sustainable growth. He will be able to thank Madoff for giving us the simplest possible explanation of what we knew all along but chose to ignore: that there’s still no such thing as a free lunch.

Diesel-Abgastests: VW gesteht Manipulation
341 Postings
VW-Chef Martin Winterkorn drückt sein Bedauern darüber aus, das Vertrauen von Kunden und der Öffentlichkeit enttäuscht zu haben
Wolfsburg – Volkswagen hat Manipulationsvorwürfe der US-Umweltbehörde EPA bei Abgastests von Dieselautos in den USA eingeräumt. ""Die Manipulation an der eingesetzten Software hat es gegeben"", sagte ein Sprecher des Konzerns am Sonntag in Wolfsburg.
Zuvor hatte VW-Chef Martin Winterkorn in einer Erklärung sein Bedauern darüber ausgedrückt, das Vertrauen von Kunden und der Öffentlichkeit enttäuscht zu haben. Der Vorstand nehme die Verstöße sehr ernst.  Winterkorn hat  eine umfassende Aufklärung des Abgasskandals angekündigt. ""Ich persönlich bedauere zutiefst, dass wir das Vertrauen unserer Kunden und der Öffentlichkeit enttäuscht haben"", teilte Winterkorn am Sonntag in Wolfsburg mit.
Höchste Priorität
""Die Geschehnisse haben für uns im Vorstand und für mich ganz persönlich höchste Priorität."" Die US-Umweltbehörde EPA beschuldigte VW, mithilfe einer Software die Resultate von Abgasuntersuchungen von Diesel-Pkw geschönt haben.
VW habe eine externe Untersuchung in Auftrag gegeben. ""Klar ist: Volkswagen duldet keine Regel- oder Gesetzesverstöße jedweder Art"", sagte Winterkorn. Volkswagen werde alles daran setzen, Vertrauen, wiederzugewinnen. ""Wir arbeiten mit den zuständigen Behörden offen und umfassend zusammen, um den Sachverhalt schnell und transparent vollumfänglich zu klären"", sagte der Konzernchef.
Die US-Umweltbehörde EPA warf VW vor, die Ermittlungen von Abgaswerten bei Dieselfahrzeugen manipuliert zu haben. Betroffen sind bisher rund 482.000 Autos. Laut EPA soll das Programm ermöglichen, das Abgas-Kontrollsystem nur bei offiziellen Emissionstests zu aktivieren. Das würde bedeuten, dass die Luftverpestung im Normalbetrieb viel höher wäre. Bisher seien Fahrzeuge der Baujahre 2009 bis 2015 aufgefallen, darunter das für VW in den USA wichtigste Modell Jetta, aber auch der Golf, Beetle und der Passat und der Audi A3.
""Solche Mittel zu benutzen, um die Klimaschutzstandards zu umgehen, ist illegal und eine Bedrohung für die öffentliche Gesundheit"", hatte EPA-Vertreterin Cynthia Giles gesagt. Ihre Behörde werde die Untersuchungen in diesem ""sehr ernsten"" Fall fortsetzen. Dabei sei nicht auszuschließen, dass weitere Verdachtsfälle ans Licht kämen.
Praxis in Europa untersuchen
Autoexperte Ferdinand Dudenhöffer fordert nun auch, die Praxis von Abgastests in Europa zu untersuchen. ""Sicherlich müssen jetzt auch die EU-Kommission und das Bundesverkehrsministerium den Dingen nachgehen und klären, inwieweit diese Software auch in Europa und Deutschland eingesetzt wurde und falsche Abgaswerte vorgaukelt"", sagte Dudenhöffer den Zeitungen der Funke Mediengruppe (""Berliner Morgenpost"", ""Hamburger Abendblatt"", ""Westdeutsche Allgemeine"").
Daimler-Chef Dieter Zetsche sagte am Sonntag bei einer Veranstaltung der Wochenzeitung ""Die Zeit"", es sei zu früh, um die Sache zu bewerten. ""Ich weiß viel zu wenig über den Fall, um zunächst mal beurteilen zu können, wie gerechtfertigt der Vorwurf Volkswagen gegenüber ist und ob wir zu hundert Prozent und in jeder Betrachtungsweise davor völlig sicher sein können"", sagte Zetsche.
Der Autofachmann Stefan Bratzel von der Fachhochschule der Wirtschaft in Bergisch Gladbach sagte, bei VW müsse es strukturelle Änderungen geben. ""Da ist etwas fundamental schiefgegangen bei VW"", sagte Bratzel der Deutschen Presse-Agentur (dpa). Es sei sehr verwunderlich, dass die mutmaßlichen Machenschaften der amerikanischen US-Tochter nicht längst an Wolfsburg gemeldet worden seien und das Durchgreifen der Konzernspitze nach sich gezogen hätte.
Bärendienst für Technologie
Wie andere Branchenkenner ist Bratzel entsetzt: ""Das ist ein Bärendienst für die ganze deutsche Dieseltechnologie"", sagt er. Hierdurch würde das Image von Dieselautos – in den USA ohnehin in einer Nische – schwer beschädigt. Auch BMW und Daimler seien dadurch indirekt betroffen. ""Man versucht seit Jahren, die Dieseltechnologie zu etablieren in den USA – und jetzt das"", sagte Bratzel. (APA/Reuters, 20.9.2015)

A man carries a bag of rice in a granary in Hangzhou in east China’s Zhejiang province Tuesday April 29, 2008. Experts say prices for rice, corn, wheat and other food staples have skyrocketed in recent months, driven by record oil costs, severe droughts, the diversion of corn for ethanol use and rapidly growing demand in China and India.(AP Photo)
LAGUNA NIGUEL, Russell T. Spears: In his column, “AAA wrong on ethanol” [Opinion, Jan. 14], Marshall Kaplan, advisor to Fuel Freedom Foundation, criticizes AAA for pointing out that alcohol added to gasoline is harmful to the automobile motor and fuel systems. He should talk to independent mechanics to confirm that even 10 percent alcohol is causing much damage to automobile engines and fuel systems.
The fuel pumps fail from
corrosion and can stop a car on a busy freeway. This is very dangerous. Fuel pumps are inside the fuel tank on most cars now, and it is very expensive to have the tank removed and opened to take out the fuel pump. Alcohol makes the engines run hotter and it wears them out sooner.
Alcohol also damages the valves requiring more expensive repairs. Ethanol has less energy than gasoline so cars get worse mileage when it is mixed with gasoline.
Small boats use fiberglass fuel tanks because they are safer than steel. However, the alcohol in the gasoline eats through the fiberglass tank, causing gasoline to spill into the engine space. The U.S. Coast Guard warned the Environmental Protection Agency about the danger of alcohol in small boats but the agency supports it anyway. I’m inclined to believe AAA more than our corrupt and incompetent EPA.
______
MISSION VIEJO, Tom Anderson:  I appreciated the recent editorial on the new ethanol blend [“Hit the brakes on new ethanol blend,” Jan. 10]. Unfortunately, we know the new blend of 15 percent ethanol will happen.
There is an adage about needing to “follow the money.” Businessman Warren Buffett controls most of the transporting of ethanol. Howard Buffett, his son, is chairman of the Nebraska Ethanol Authority and Development Board and served on the board of Archer Daniels Midland Co. ADM transforms crops, such as corn, into agriculturally derived fuels and chemicals.
All the major car companies may be able to void warranties, according to AAA. So who is left to pay for all of the repairs?
Robert Citron’s passing
SAN CLEMENTE, David Wiechert, former criminal defense attorney for Robert Citron: Orange County lost one of its finest today [“Robert Citron, behind O.C. bankruptcy, dies,” Local, Jan. 17]. Robert Citron, a dedicated public servant for more than a quarter century, exuded the most treasured human emotion – love. Bob loved his country, his county, his school, and, above all, his dear wife of more than 50 years, Terry. He will be missed.
Immigration truths
CORONA DEL MAR, Bill Cool: Bill Watkins’ column, “Immigrants not a burden but a boon to economy” [Opinion, Jan. 14], makes strong arguments but glosses over some important facts.
Our nation’s successes can be traced to our constitutional freedoms and immigration. Watkins is right to emphasize the importance of immigrants starting businesses that have helped generate economic growth.
Yet missing from his piece is that 57 percent of immigrant households with children receive some sort of welfare (this includes a large number of households with working adults in the home), according to the non-partisan Center for Immigration Studies. It was also misleading to assert “that immigrants take few, if any, jobs from native-born Americans.”
The Center for Immigration Studies showed that the number of working-age immigrants who are employed has risen from 21.2 million to 23.2 million. The native-born employment has risen by only one million to a total of 119.9 million. “A new analysis of government data shows that two-thirds of the net increase in employment, since President Barack Obama took office, has gone to immigrant workers, primarily legal immigrants,” according to CIS.
Americans overwhelmingly support immigration, but we should not admit such a large number of foreign workers that it is to the detriment of Americans.
Policies have resulted in putting millions of native-born citizens in the unemployment lines. Congress is about to take on the task of changing our immigration laws. Hopefully the effort will be a sincere one that does not pander to special-interest groups and corrects the abuses in our current situation.
Labor union trouble
ANAHEIM, Richard J. Stegemeier: Columnist Kevin O’Leary’s plea for a revitalization of labor unions ignores the facts [“’Right to work’ sets workers free to freeload,” Jan. 10]. Union membership has fallen for decades because workers are dissatisfied. For example, O’Leary says a worker receives about $1,500 less in a right-to-work state than in a non-right to work state.
But the average member of the United Auto Workers at General Motors pays $950 in union dues, nearly double what it was in 2004. When workers look at well-paid nonunion Toyota and Honda workers in right-to-work states, they see little benefit from the UAW. GM workers understand that their $950 a year is not spent solely to improve their lives. Only 38 percent of that money stays with the local union.
Intelligent workers also wonder why the UAW maintains an asset base of $1.25 billion, or about $3,300 per worker. Millions of those surplus funds go directly into the coffers of the Democratic National Committee without the approval of UAW workers.
Yes, America should continue to guarantee the civil right to organize labor unions. But individual rights must not be destroyed by the union’s drive to eliminate a secret ballot where intimidation and threats are important organizing tools, which seems to be the intent of union organizers and of the Obama administration.
The opinion agenda
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Michael Wilson:  Letter-writer S. Roberts of Laguna Hills lumps registered Independents with the Democratic demographic in Orange County, implying that 55 percent of the population would support a more liberal agenda at the Register [“Improvements overdue,” Letters, Jan. 12]. A large percentage of Independents are former Republicans who have been discouraged with the increasingly moderate leanings of the party but would still lean that direction and never to the political Left.
Sometime around the age of 30, I finally grew up, left the Democratic Party, stopped reading the Los Angeles Times and began subscribing to the Orange County Register. Recent changes in the paper have been mostly very positive, and I believe it is reasonable to have a balanced approach to the Opinion pages. However, don’t abandon the tradition of the publication. You’ll not find success catering to the new Left of Orange County. Most of them will continue to get their news from MSNBC and from the Internet.
Los Alamitos’ manager
WESTMINSTER, Nicholas Berger:  Angie Avery, Los Alamitos’ new city manager, left her $126,039-per-year job with the Los Alamitos Parks Department for the city manger’s job at $170,000 per year, a $43,961 increase [“Los Alamitos city manager retires after one year,” Local, Jan. 11]. She told the Register she swapped positions “to provide continuity” and “not to increase her salary before retiring.” If you believe that, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.

HOLLYWOOD – God bless America, and how’s everybody?
• Oklahoma Sooners coach Bob Stoops hinted Monday that OU may play in the Dallas Cowboys’ new stadium this fall. They’d play Brigham Young. If there’s one thing you can count on with these two schools it’s that there won’t be a gay wedding at halftime.
• The Dallas Cowboys lost Saturday in their final football game at Texas Stadium after 40 years. They move to their new stadium next fall. Texas Stadium will be imploded just as soon as it gets approval from regulators to become a commercial bank.
• President Ronald Reagan’s favorite White House egg nog recipe turned up on the Internet this week. It’s one part egg nog and three parts bourbon. The Gipper always believed in peace through strength.
• Barack Obama was seen on news clips swinging a golf club in Hawaii Monday. He’s kept a Republican Defense Secretary, he’s named a conservative economic team, he’s asked an evangelical to give his Inaugural invocation, and now he’s playing golf. The Dwight D. Eisenhower Library just announced that Ike was our first black president.
• Congressman Barney Frank slammed Barack Obama for inviting a pastor opposed to gay marriage to pray at the Inaugural. The president-elect met him halfway. He’s agreed to take the oath of office with his left hand on a copy of The Paul Lynde Story.
• Pastor Rick Warren was chosen to give the Inaugural prayer in January. He has a huge evangelical church in Orange County. You can’t scare people in Southern California with descriptions of hellfire, it sounds like just another October to them.
• Governor Rod Blagojevich told Chicago reporters Friday he is innocent of corruption charges against him. The man dresses beautifully. All Illinois governors wear pinstripe suits so they never have to bring a change of clothing into prison.
• Wall Street crook Bernie Madoff was placed under house arrest Friday after confessing to swindling people out of $50 billion. He took money from new investors to pay off old investors, hoping nobody would notice. It’s an old scam called Social Security.
• The White House loaned GM and Chrysler seventeen billion in bailout cash to keep them afloat. One thing you must say for Detroit. U.S. auto executives didn’t waste their time with a third-rate nation like Iraq, they lost to Japan and Germany like men.
• Dick Cheney ripped Joe Biden Sunday for criticizing his expansion of executive power. He said there are no limits on power in wartime. The Founding Fathers should have foreseen that the World Trade Center might not have a back-up sprinkler system.
• Saudi Arabia’s rulers lifted a 30-year-old ban on movies Monday. They said movies must show good and not violate Islamic law. The first movie they allowed to be shown was Exodus, but they had to run it backwards so it would have a happy ending.
• Valkyrie opens Thursday starring Tom Cruise about the German war hero who tried to kill Hitler with a bomb. He won the role after another actor bowed out. Part of Mel Gibson’s plea agreement with the Malibu judge is that he never plays a Nazi again.
• NBC News anchor Chris Matthews reportedly decided Monday to stay on television and not run for the U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He doesn’t have what it takes to win a statewide election. Once you’ve said on national television that Barack Obama makes you feel a thrill up your leg, you can pretty much write off the rural counties.

Bernie Madoff: World’s Most Honest Fraudster
The most shocking aspect of the Madoff saga isn’t the crimes he’s accused of—it’s the lack of a cover-up.
I’ve made my living in the peculiar art of crisis management for more than a quarter century, so I’m rarely surprised when I read about disasters such as the alleged geothermal fraud of investor Bernard Madoff.
Specifically, what floored me about the Madoff coverage were the reports that he had conceded to his sons and associates that “it was all just one big lie.” My experience with these affairs is that the accused uber-gonif tells everyone who will listen, including his legal and damage control team, that the charges against him are “total bullshit.” Not that some of the allegations are wrong; rather Virtually Every Negative Thing Being Said About Me Is 100% Certified Grade-A Imported Bullshit.
No sane attorney would sanction an out-of-the-gate mea culpa if there was any chance their client might secure his liberty (or his house in Southampton).
While Madoff’s reported confession is cold comfort to those investors, and, monstrously, the charities that invested with him, it is, nevertheless, an interesting clinical development in the science of crisis management.
For decades – I trace it back to Watergate – pundits and journalists have trafficked in the twin canards: “Fess up and the problem will go away” and “It’s the cover up that nails you.”
The truth is more banal and depressing. The reasons scandal figures don’t fess up is that they don’t believe they did anything wrong, and, perhaps most tactically, confessions and expressions of remorse are usually admissible in criminal and civil court. Enough rapscallions have been acquitted, or negotiated attractive pleas, that no sane attorney would sanction an out-of-the-gate mea culpa if there was any chance their client might secure his liberty (or his house in Southampton).
A similar logic applies to the “it’s the cover-up that gets you” bromide. As the late George Carlin once observed, “People in Washington say it’s not the initial offense that gets you into trouble, it’s the cover-up. They say you should admit what you did, get the story out and move on. What this overlooks is the fact that most of the time the cover-up works just fine, and nobody finds out a damned thing.”
Implicit in Carlin’s message is that admissions don’t make your victims and the public want to forgive you, they make them want to kill you. Furthermore, not all cover-ups are cover-ups in the criminal sense. The same kind of breathtaking confidence and lack of self-awareness that it takes to tell one’s associates that “it’s all bullshit” also enables charismatic thieves to build Potemkin Villages in the first place.
This brings us to the subtext of most of these financial scandals: Why do smart people who instinctively hang up on telemarketers believe in self-promoting gurus promising geometric returns? Greed and naiveté are the convenient explanations, and I expect that most of the charities that lost money with Madoff had the noblest motives.
Still, there is another pathology operating here: The need to believe in shamans and gurus is often tied to the aspiration of the successful for the cross-validation that comes from inclusion in an ultra-elite club. Put differently, to invest with a wizard is to be among the Wizard Class, to be one of The Chosen elected to benefit from inside shibboleths.
Perhaps the most diabolically clever aspect of Madoff’s pitch was not his promise of outrageous returns, but his promise of exclusivity – the notion that he actively rejected unworthy clients in the manner that the Ivy League rejects second-tier applicants. It is of no small consequence that Madoff conducted much of his business at highly selective country clubs.
Nobody wants to be the rube that listens to a Madoffian pitch only to raise his hand and say, “I don’t get it.” Better to fork over your life savings to a top-drawer shuck-and-jive artist than announce you’ve decided just to pay off your mortgage instead (to the sniggering of financial sophisticates about how you’re pissing away a tax deduction, you community college nimrod). As Professor Marvel admonishes Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, “Professor Marvel never guesses. He knows!” The good professor, of course, is played by the same actor who demands that Dorothy and her cohort “pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,” who turns out to be nothing but the fraudulent Wizard of Oz himself.
I routinely see this desire for wizards in my crisis management work. When mega-successful companies or individuals get in trouble they seek attorneys and PR people whom they believe will throw pixie dust in the eyes of the judge, jury and the New York Times, resulting in acquittal and, perhaps, a comeback cover of Fortune.
There is, of course, no pixie dust, just good and bad facts, good and bad laws, and plausible narratives and laughable whoppers. If Madoff’s reputed confession turns out to be true, it will be a lousy legal strategy. But I would like to think it could represent a turning point in our culture’s ethical and spiritual management of malfeasance. Might would-be felons realize that the consequences of swindle won’t be the successful obfuscation of a magician, but the abject surrender of a petty thief?
I am not optimistic. I see no evidence that people learn from the mistakes of fallen icons, which one would think are self-evident—Ivan Boesky, Dennis Kozlowski, et al. Alas, these guys were different.
I suspect that Madoff’s confession is an aberration borne out of the visceral catharsis that occurs when the Joker in the deck suddenly turns up -- the Joker that precedes a catastrophic depression.
Trust me. Like Professor Marvel, I know.

La validité de l’enquête sur la sextape de Valbuena contestée devant la Cour de cassation
Le footballeur Karim Benzema, mis en examen dans cette affaire, conteste notamment des écoutes obtenues de façon litigieuse.

Le footballeur Karim Benzema conteste mardi 20 juin devant la Cour de cassation la validité de l’ enquête dans l’affaire de tentative de chantage à la sextape contre son ancien coéquipier en équipe de France , Mathieu Valbuena, dans laquelle il est mis en examen .
Mi-décembre 2016, la cour d’appel de Versailles a approuvé le versement au dossier des écoutes litigieuses entre un corbeau, qui avait affirmé détenir une vidéo intime concernant M. Valbuena, et un policier sous couverture qui s’était fait passer pour l’homme de main de ce dernier.
Karim Benzema, tout comme un autre des protagonistes du dossier, Karim Zenati, un ami de ses amis d’enfance, a formé un pourvoi en cassation, estimant que l’officier avait utilisé des méthodes pousse-au-crime. Dans son avis avant l’audience, l’avocat général préconise le rejet de cette requête, selon une source proche du dossier.

Le rôle de Djibril Cissé
L’affaire avait débuté en juin 2015, lorsque Mathieu Valbuena a reçu un appel de cet inconnu. Le maître chanteur proposait au milieu offensif de l’Olympique Lyonnais de trouver un arrangement, sans évoquer le montant à payer , conduisant l’ international français à déposer plainte. Une négociation avait alors commencé entre un policier et l’escroc.
Un mois plus tôt, Djibril Cissé avait fait part au joueur de « murmures », évoquant l’existence de cette vidéo supposément compromettante. Il a été mis en examen fin février . La justice cherche notamment à savoir dans quelles conditions l’ancien attaquant a pris connaissance de la sextape, à savoir s’il l’a seulement visionnée ou s’il l’a téléchargée sur son téléphone portable.
L’enquête avait permis d’identifier les cerveaux présumés de l’entreprise de chantage, Mustapha Zouaoui et Axel Angot, qui gravitent depuis des années autour des footballeurs, ainsi que le corbeau présumé, Younès Houass. MM. Zouaoui et Angot s’étaient ensuite tournés vers Karim Zenati, afin que Karim Benzema pousse Mathieu Valbuena à payer. Ils ont été mis en examen pour tentative de chantage ou complicité et participation à une association de malfaiteurs.

Some city officials – including the city attorney and four of five City Council members – are warning of dire consequences if voters turn down two measures on the June 5 primary ballot that would increase densities to allow possible low-cost, multi-family housing units.
The warnings are included in City Attorney Todd Litfin’s “impartial analysis” of Measures H and I and in arguments favoring the measures. Council members John Anderson, Tom Lindsey and Jim Winder signed both arguments, while Nancy Rikel signed one argument.
Mailing of the analysis and arguments to this city’s registered voters – numbering 43,331 as of April 4 – will begin April 26 and end by a May 26 deadline, the county Registrar of Voters announced. Last day to register to vote is May 21.
According to Litfin’s analysis, if the measures fail, “the city could potentially be more susceptible to legal challenges alleging that the city is in violation of state housing laws.”
Litfin further stated, “If the city were to lose such a lawsuit, the city could suffer severe legal ramifications including, but not limited to, court-ordered compliance with state law, the suspension of the city’s power to issue building permits or other land use approvals, judicial control of housing project approvals and potential payment of attorney fees.”
Measure H will change zoning on two Savi Ranch properties to allow up to 30 units per acre and heights of 50 feet or four stories, whichever is less. However, the argument for H states the developer has agreed to build no more than 21.6 units per acre.
Measure I will change zoning on nine west-side properties to allow 10 units per acre on three sites, 20 units per acre on two sites (with heights to 35 feet or two stories, plus one-half story for underground parking) and 30 units per acre on four sites (heights to 50 feet).
Litfin’s analysis doesn’t mention the acreage of each property or the total number of units allowed if each measure passes, but based on other city reports, my calculations show that the west-side parcels total nearly 40 acres and could support 770 units and the Savi Ranch parcels total six acres and could support 180 units, although around 130 are planned.
But Litfin does note the measures don’t “require that property owners construct such housing on the identified sites.” They “merely” allow “such housing to potentially be built. Whether the property is, or is not, developed is up to the property owner.”
The four council members who signed the argument favoring Measure H claimed the state “could penalize the city and implement their own housing plan without our community’s input,” with the city facing lawsuits and “spending millions on attorneys and settlement fees….”
The three council members who signed the argument favoring Measure I stated that passage could “prevent a losing, costly legal battle.” They noted that 24 cities and counties “have spent millions fighting the state-imposed mandates and all have lost.”
Council set aside $45,000 to educate voters about the measures, so expect mailers and public meetings to often stress these calamitous consequences.

ALASKA
Ex-lawmaker guilty of bribery
ANCHORAGE — A former Alaskan lawmaker was convicted of bribery yesterday for getting thousands of dollars out of a corrections-company consultant in exchange for his help in the Legislature.
“I’m devastated,” former state Rep. Tom Anderson said after the federal jury announced its verdict. Anderson, 39, was accused of conspiring to take money that he thought was coming from a private prison firm, Cornell Industries, Inc.
The money was supplied by the FBI through an informant working for Cornell who secretly recorded his conversations with Anderson and a co-conspirator, former municipal lobbyist Bill Bobrick. Judge John Sedwick ordered Anderson to surrender his passport and scheduled sentencing for Oct. 2.
CALIFORNIA
Bus strike disrupts morning commute
SANTA ANA — Orange County’s first bus strike in more than two decades disrupted the morning commute for thousands of riders yesterday after 1,100 transportation workers walked off the job.
The strike began Saturday after union leaders rejected a proposed contract offer.
Only 31 of the county’s 81 bus lines were still running, most of them short routes and rail feeders operated by a subcontractor. Transit officials were bracing for plenty of confusion and frustrated residents.
“We’re really hopeful this won’t be a long-term situation. We want the union to come back and talk to us,” said transit spokesman Joel Zlotnik.
Orange County Transportation Authority board members were to meet yesterday to discuss their next move, and members of the union picketed outside the transit headquarters. Both sides agreed yesterday morning to resume negotiations later in the day, which Mr. Zlotnik called a positive step.
About 70 percent of the public-transportation riders don’t have access to a car.
The drivers are demanding a 14 percent pay raise spread over three years.
IDAHO
More inmates may go to problematic prison
BOISE — The state’s top prison official wants to send more inmates to a Texas lockup run by a private company, which is accused of abuse by guards, a suicide, filthy conditions and lack of treatment.
Prison Director Brent Reinke concedes his agency failed to properly monitor conditions but said moving inmates to another prison run by the GEO Group doesn’t mean problems will recur.
ILLINOIS
Van injures four at Cosi restaurant
CHICAGO — A van veered off a downtown street and slammed into a restaurant Monday, injuring four persons, two critically, authorities said.
The driver suddenly veered onto the sidewalk about 9:30 a.m., hitting a pedestrian and striking the Cosi restaurant, Chicago police spokesman John Henry said. A witness said the driver appeared to have been trying to avoid another vehicle.
The pedestrian and a person in the van were taken to hospitals in critical condition, said Chicago Fire Department spokeswoman Eve Rodriguez. Two others injured in the van were in stable and good condition, she said.
Mr. Henry said police had not determined whether citations would be issued.
“I’ve been shaking all morning,” said Tom McCarthy, 30, who was at the restaurant and saw the crash. “It was just the scariest thing I’d ever seen.”
INDIANA
Wandering toddler’s mother pleads guilty
INDIANAPOLIS — A woman whose 3-year-old son was found wandering on a busy highway pleaded guilty yesterday to child neglect charges.
Nancy Dyer, 31, was arrested Dec. 30 after stunned motorists found her son running on Interstate 465 on the city’s northwestern side, wearing only a diaper and a T-shirt. The boy was not hurt.
Dyer admitted in court before her bench trial was to start that she had been sleeping about 9 a.m. the day her son was found on the highway and that she knew the boy could get out of their apartment. She pleaded guilty to three of four counts against her of neglect of a dependent.
Prosecutor Carl Brizzi said his office would seek a two-year prison term for Dyer when she is sentenced Aug. 20. He said it was just happenstance that the boy was not hurt.
Authorities said at least six cars and a semitrailer swerved into other highway lanes to avoid the boy, who after leaving the family’s second-floor apartment, got around a fence and onto the highway about 200 yards away.
KENTUCKY
Body of missing boy found in garbage truck
LOUISVILLE — The body of a 4-year-old boy who disappeared outside his home near Churchill Downs was found in a garbage truck over the weekend, and authorities say he was killed.
Cezar “Ivan” Aguilar-Cano was last seen playing outside his apartment building on June 29 near the home of the Kentucky Derby. His death was a homicide, Jefferson County Coroner Ron Holmes said.
Trash workers discovered the body Saturday in the neighborhood where he was last seen alive.
Police had received more than 100 tips, and authorities, friends and neighbors organized extensive searches for the child. A Louisville-based advocacy group for missing children, the Exploited Children’s Help Organization, asked volunteers to take thousands of fliers door to door within a mile of the boy’s home to dig up leads.
Neighbors told police that Cesar was a curious boy who would sometimes run around the complex unsupervised. It wasn’t uncommon for the boy to go inside open apartment doors, they said
No arrests have been made, authorities said.
MICHIGAN
Court officials’ cars head for auction block
LANSING — This year’s state auction of surplus vehicles will include vehicles that members of the state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals drove at taxpayer expense until earlier this year.
Justices and judges gave up their vehicles this year as the state faced a budget crisis. Use of state vehicles was a perk dating to the 1960s.
NEVADA
Man charged in acrobat-slave case
LAS VEGAS — Three men are facing criminal charges in Las Vegas over slavery accusations concerning 20 members of a Chinese acrobatic troupe, justice officials said yesterday.
A spokesman for the FBI’s Las Vegas office said the men — Li Youzhi, 38, Shen Yang, 21, and Hu Jun, 43 — were arrested last week after authorities were contacted by a woman working with the troupe.
The woman, a Chinese national who worked as an interpreter for the team — China Star Acrobats — told police that she and other members of the squad were being held against their will, the FBI said.
The FBI raided the house in Las Vegas and found 14 members of the troupe who were identified as victims of human trafficking and were then taken into protective custody.
An FBI spokesman said the acrobats had been given limited food, were not being paid the salary promised to them and had had their passports and visas confiscated.
They were also watched and controlled by “enforcers,” who instilled a fear that “their families in China, as well as themselves, would be harmed if they attempted to leave,” the FBI said.
Prosecutors say the acrobats were also forced to live with up to six people in a room.
NEW HAMPSHIRE
Infection reporting gets $1 in funds
CONCORD — Hospitals are unlikely to comply with a new state law requiring them to report when patients contract three serious infections because the legislature allocated only $1 for the program.
Supporters say the public deserves to know about hospital-acquired infections, but opponents argue tracking and reporting the data is complex and expensive.
NEW JERSEY
Charges dropped for exonerated man
ELIZABETH — Prosecutors yesterday dropped all the remaining charges against a man who spent 22 years in prison for the murder and rape of two children but was recently freed after DNA testing exonerated him.
In a statement released before a court hearing yesterday, Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow said he decided not to pursue the remaining charges after “careful re-evaluation of the case” against Byron Halsey.
Mr. Halsey, 46, was released from prison on May 15 after prosecutors threw out his convictions. New DNA testing, not available when he was convicted, linked a neighbor to the crime.
However, until yesterday, Mr. Halsey still faced charges of aggravated sexual assault, aggravated manslaughter, felony murder, child abuse and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.
Mr. Halsey was convicted in 1988 of murdering and sexually assaulting Tyrone and Tina Urquhart, the children of his live-in girlfriend, at a Plainfield rooming house.
NORTH CAROLINA
UNC president hits state lottery ads
CHAPEL HILL — University of North Carolina President Erskine Bowles said state campuses shouldn’t allow ads for the state lottery at sporting events because they encourage gambling.
The contracts between the lottery and the universities for radio ads, signs and announcements during games expired last week, and the president asked chancellors not to renew contracts.
SOUTH DAKOTA
Mother Nature gives firefighters a hand
HOT SPRINGS — Overnight rain and lower temperatures slowed a wildfire that had raced out of a canyon, destroyed at least 30 houses and killed a homeowner who went back to try to save his belongings, a top fire official said yesterday.
The change in weather gave firefighters a chance to shore up their fire lines, though conditions could shift again for the worse, state wildland fire coordinator Joe Lowe told crews at a morning briefing held in light rain.
“This fire is not over yet,” he said. “This fire could come back to life again.”
The blaze was started by lightning on Saturday, and by yesterday, it had covered about 11 square miles just southwest of Hot Springs, on the southern side of the Black Hills. It was 20 percent contained, and crews expected to have it fully contained by Thursday. A state highway that cuts through the fire area remained closed.
Among the evacuees taking shelter at a Hot Springs community center was Mary Goulet, who said she and her husband didn’t realize the seriousness until it was almost too late. She said she called 911 when fire surrounded the house.
“The flames burned our cars, and we couldn’t get out,” she said. Then a firefighter in protective gear appeared at their door and led them to his firetruck and to escape, she said.
Crews in California’s eastern Sierra Nevada also gained ground against a fire that had charred at least 37,000 acres, or 58 square miles, in the Inyo National Forest.
TEXAS
Fresh flooding renews misery
DALLAS — A new round of flooding swamped parts of Texas, leading officials in one county to declare a fresh disaster area in the hard-hit Plains.
Smith County officials made a disaster declaration Sunday night, asking for state and federal aid. They say flooding has caused about $200,000 worth of damage to their eastern Texas county.
“We still have areas that are dangerous,” county Commissioner Bill McGinnis told KLTV of Tyler. “We have barricaded those off. We beg people not to go around those barricades because it is just so extremely dangerous to do that.”
The search for a 26-year-old man missing since his raft capsized on the rain-swollen Trinity River near Fort Worth resumed yesterday morning, said Kent Worley, spokesman for the Fort Worth Fire Department.
Teams had shifted their search from a rescue mission to a recovery, Mr. Worley said.
“The water has gone down, but it’s still fairly swift. It’s still fairly rapid,” he said.
In central Texas, some homes in low-lying areas were flooded in Hico, about 100 miles southwest of Dallas. No injuries were reported, but some major roads into the town were closed.
WYOMING
High temperatures blamed in fish deaths
YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK — A heat wave has warmed the Firehole River to as much as 82 degrees, killing hundreds of rainbow and brown trout.
Park officials say the trout died last week when temperatures reached triple digits in some places. The warm water has prompted voluntary fishing restrictions along several Yellowstone rivers and streams.

Followers of the past year and a half’s financial misadventures have become inured to bucketfuls of red ink. Even so, the potential losses from the scam perpetrated by Bernie Madoff, a Wall Street veteran, are jaw-dropping. The $17 billion of investors’ funds that his firm supposedly held earlier this year have all but evaporated and the hole could be as big as $50 billion. That would make it the biggest financial fraud in history.
Details are still emerging, but Mr. Madoff has himself described it as a giant Ponzi scheme. For years, it seems, the returns paid to investors came, in part at least, not from real investment gains but from inflows from new clients. It might still have been going on, were it not for the global financial crisis. Redemption requests for $7 billion, by investors looking to pull back from turbulent stockmarkets, forced Mr. Madoff to admit that his coffers were empty — bearing out Warren Buffett’s adage that only when the tide goes out is it clear who was swimming naked.
Recommended Stories:
“Every Crisis Begins with a Shock”
The affair has robbed an embarrassingly long list of supposedly sophisticated investors of their swimwear. Hundreds of banks, hedge funds and wealthy individuals parked money with Mr. Madoff, impressed by the steady returns on offer: 10-15 percent a year, even in rough times, with barely a down month. Global banks such as Banco Santander, BNP Paribas and HSBC, all three of which had until now survived the credit crisis relatively unscathed, are among those reported to be heavily exposed. So too is Bramdean Alternatives, a fund run by Nicola “Superwoman” Horlick, a celebrated British money manager. Others had most or even all of their eggs in the Madoff basket. Several well-heeled Americans have reportedly lost everything but their properties.
Why were they not suspicious of the unnaturally consistent returns? Mr. Madoff’s pedigree may have played a part. A former chairman of the NASDAQ stockmarket, he has long been a fixture on Wall Street. He even has an exemption (to the former “uptick rule” for short-selling) named after him. He has served on an advisory committee assembled by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), America’s main market watchdog. Savvy marketing was another factor. Investors had to be invited, lending his operation an air of exclusivity. This went down well in the country clubs of Florida, Minnesota and other states, where the firm’s unofficial agents told of Bernie’s magic touch, explaining that not anyone could get in, yet always somehow finding space for those who fancied a piece.
According to reports, some of those who put their faith in Mr. Madoff suspected that he was engaged in wrongdoing, but not the sort that would endanger their money. They thought he might be trading illegally for their benefit on information gleaned by a separate business within his group, which made a market in shares. The firm had been investigated more than once for “front-running”, using information about client orders to trade for its own account before filling those orders.
Even so, the affair has — like the subprime-mortgage debacle — exposed a stunning lack of due diligence. Droves of investors who should have known better tossed in billions, preferring to keep their fingers crossed rather than ask awkward questions of a firm whose investment strategy was vague and opaque. Even within his own group, Mr. Madoff’s money-management business was a black box: no one but he had full access to the accounts. As a broker-dealer, it was able to clear its own trades, a privilege that should give pause for thought. Worse, questions had been hanging over the operation since the mid-1990s. Some institutional investors have long steered clear of Mr. Madoff, unable to understand how he spun his gold, or uneasy that his books were audited by a tiny, three-person accounting firm.
The SEC, which seems to have been taken aback by the scale of the malfeasance, can hardly hold its head up high either. It did not get round to examining the books of Mr. Madoff’s money-management business, even though he registered it with the commission in September 2006 — though it did probe the market-making arm and found that it had violated some technical rules.
For an agency that is fighting for its life, that is unfortunate. Even before this scandal the SEC was on the back foot, having stood by as the big Wall Street investment banks it was charged with policing ran amok. In its defence, the commission argued that its primary role was investor protection, not prudential regulation. Now it has been shown wanting in its core competence — though, with 11,000 fund managers to oversee, not to mention the boom in mortgage-related cases, some may think it inevitable. Congress is next year expected to revamp America’s dysfunctional system of financial regulation. One option, already proposed by Hank Paulson, the outgoing treasury secretary, is to fold the SEC’s responsibilities into a new set of agencies.
The sloppy regulators and credulous investors whom Mr. Madoff duped must now hope that he has pulled off one last deceit: exaggerating the scale of the losses. Even in these accident-prone times $50 billion sounds like an awful lot for one man to lose. But it is just about possible if he levered up his bets with borrowed money or supercharged them with derivatives (which he is known to have used to reduce volatility). But even if the fraud extends no further than the $17 billion under management, it will go down as a humdinger. Indeed, it makes Charles Ponzi’s promise in 1920 to double investors’ money in three months — which caused losses equivalent to around $160 million in today’s money — look like a trifle. Perhaps from now on it should be known as the “Madoff scheme.”

Manipuliert Volkswagen die Abgase?

Rückruf von 500.000 Autos Manipuliert Volkswagen die Abgase?
Neuer Ärger für den Wolfsburger Automobilkonzern: Hunderttausende Autos mussten zurück gerufen werden. Doch womöglich droht dem Unternehmen eine noch viel teurere Strafe.
Volkswagen-Chef Martin Winterkorn auf der IAA in Frankfurt
© AFP Volkswagen-Chef Martin Winterkorn auf der IAA in Frankfurt
Mitten in die Internationale Automobilmesse IAA platzt neuer Ärger für Volkswagen-Chef Martin Winterkorn - diesmal direkt aus den Vereinigten Staaten. Die Vorwürfe, die dort von der amerikanischen Regierung nach Wolfsburg geschickt werden, klingen einigermaßen bizarr: Der weltgrößte Autohersteller (gleichauf mit Toyota) soll bei seinen Diesel-Modellen eine spezielle Software eingesetzt haben, mit der die Messung des Schadstoffausstoßes manipuliert werden kann.
Autorin: Corinna Budras, Redakteurin in der Wirtschaft. Folgen:
Funktionieren soll der Schwindel angeblich so: Droht einer der üblichen Abgastests, reduziert das Programm die Emissionen des Autos, um zu vertuschen, dass bei Normalbetrieb die Abgase eigentlich viel höher sind. Ohne die gezielte Reduzierung können sie bis zu 40 Mal höher liegen als vom amerikanischen Gesetz für Saubere Luft („Clean Air Act“) erlaubt. Die amerikanische Umweltbehörde EPA hat Volkswagen deshalb am Freitag aufgefordert, knapp eine halbe Millionen Autos zurückzurufen . Die Maßnahme betrifft die Modelle Jetta, Golf, Beetle und Passat, die seit 2008 verkauft wurden.
Schon das wird für den Konzern teuer. In ganz anderen Dimensionen könnte allerdings ein mögliches Bußgeld liegen: Im schlimmsten Fall summieren sich die Strafen auf rund 18 Milliarden Dollar (16 Milliarden Euro). Die bisher höchste Strafe im Zusammenhang mit einem Verstoß gegen den Clean Air Act hat im vergangenen Jahr die koreanischen Autobauer Hyundai und Kia getroffen. Sie mussten für falsche Angaben über den Benzin-Verbrauch ihrer Fahrzeuge zusammen 300 Millionen Dollar zahlen.
Umweltschutz und Nachhaltigkeit als strategische Ziele von VW
Volkswagen sei ein „sehr ernster Fall“, betonte die EPA –Vertreterin Cynthia Giles am Freitag in einem eigens anberaumten Pressetermin. Solche Mittel zu benutzen, um die Klimaschutzstandards zu umgehen, sei illegal und eine Bedrohung für die öffentliche Gesundheit. Die Abgase erhöhten den Smog, der zu Atembeschwerden und Asthma-Attacken führen könnten.
„Sehr ernst“ nimmt man den Fall deshalb auch bei Volkswagen in Nordamerika, auch weil Umweltschutz und Nachhaltigkeit zu den strategischen Zielen des Konzerns gehörten, hieß es in einer Pressemitteilung. Man kooperiere deshalb sehr eng mit den Behörden und arbeite an einer Lösung, die den Emissionsstandards genüge.
Das führt zu der Frage, was eine solche Manipulation eigentlich bringen soll, schließlich riskiert der Konzern damit viel Ärger. Den Vorwurf hat zuerst eine Forschungsgruppe für umweltfreundliche Transportsmittel (International Council on Clean Transportation) aufgebracht. Deren Geschäftsführer Drew Kodjak wirft dem Konzern vor, dadurch die Leistungsfähigkeit der Diesel-Motoren erhöhen zu wollen. Wird die Abgaskontrolle ausgeschaltet, könnte der Wagen besser beschleunigen, wird Kodjak in der „New York Times“ zitiert.
Amerikaner werden mit Volkswagen nicht warm
Ziemlich ernst war die Lage für Volkswagen auf dem amerikanischen Markt allerdings auch vorher schon: Der Absatz ist seit Jahren unbefriedigend. Das schwächelnde Amerika-Geschäft wurde als ein wichtiger Grund für den Machtkampf genannt, der in den vergangenen Monaten zwischen Winterkorn und seinem früheren Chefaufseher Ferdinand Piëch entbrannt war.
Die Amerikaner werden mit Deutschlands Lieblingsautos nicht richtig warm . Erst im August meldete der Konzern schlechte Zahlen. Die Zahl der verkauften Autos schrumpfte im Jahresvergleich um 8,1 Prozent auf rund 32300. Beim Jetta Sedan, dem wichtigsten VW-Modell in den Vereinigten Staaten, brachen die Verkäufe um knapp 18 Prozent ein. Immerhin: Bei den VW-Töchtern Audi und Porsche lief es besser.
Und nun also noch der Ärger von der amerikanischen Umweltbehörde. Allein die Rückrufaktion für die 428000 Fahrzeuge könnte sich über ein Jahr hinziehen. Nach und nach bekommen die Autobesitzer nun die Nachricht, wo sie ihren Wagen reparieren lassen können - auf Kosten des Unternehmens, versteht sich. So groß scheinen die Gefahren für die Gesundheit allerdings doch nicht zu sein: In der Zwischenzeit dürfen die Fahrzeuge weiter gefahren werden. Doch das könnte erst der Anfang sein. Die Untersuchung des Justizministerium hat gerade erst begonnen, nicht auszuschließen ist daher, dass sie noch andere Vorwürfe erhebt."

Ismael Martinez produced a 6-2, 6-3 win at No. 3, and Abraham Martinez recorded a 6-0, 6-1 victory at No. 4.
Allen Soto and Kellen Desmarteau teamed for a 6-3, 6-1 decision at No. 1 doubles. Alex King and Martin Robison were on the court a bit longer before earning a 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 victory.
Chris Cartwright and Noe Martinez pulled out a 6-3, 7-6 (6) decision at No. 3, and Tom Anderson and Luis Rodriguez pulled out a 6-3, 7-6 (6) win at No. 4.
The Panthers started the season March 10 with a 6-2 loss at Catlin Gabel.
The winners for Central were King and Robison at No. 3 doubles, and Anderson and Rodriguez at No. 4.
Gratreak lost a tough three-setter in which he failed to convert a pair of match points.
""Catlin Gabel always is real tough,"" Warkentin said. ""We competed real well against those guys. The kids are really coming along."""
67,"The Madoff mess
International — 22 December 2008 — by Evan X Hyde
Belize is very close to the United States in many different ways, hence I have been studying the Bernie Madoff saga closely, even though I have no training in finance and no knowledge of money doings.  
 
Over the past few months, a lot of people in America have lost a lot of money. Major investments banks have crashed. People have lost their pensions and their life savings. Some of the victims are Belizeans who have been working in America for decades. Main Street in America, where people work, has lost faith in Wall Street, where wizards are supposed to work miracles with money so that it grows and grows.
 
Belize has been training an inordinate number of our young people in business for two decades now. Apart from that, the politicians and supposed do-gooders are always telling us about making money available as loans for small businesses and would-be entrepreneurs. I wonder how many of these hopeful young people are being taught how bogus and treacherous it is in the necktie and three-piece business world, where every scoundrel is clean-shaven and well manicured.
 
The saga of Bernie Madoff graphically exposes the fact that the world of business and money is an insider’s world. The most important thing is who(m) you know. It’s an old boy’s network, a cartel, a syndicate. That’s how one man like Bernie Madoff could run a scheme on Wall Street and, indeed, all over the globe, wherein people, an unending stream of suckers, fought to give him their money. In the end, Madoff made a total of US$50 billion disappear into thin air. All he was doing, for years and years, was using the money from today’s sucker to give to yesterday’s sucker, and then along came tomorrow’s sucker to take care of today’s fool. In the United States, they call this a “Ponzi scheme.”
 
As Diana B. Henriques wrote on the front page of the Saturday, December 20, 2008 issue of The New York Times, “The case is still viewed more with mystery than clarity. But whatever else Mr. Madoff’s game was, it was certainly this: The first worldwide Ponzi scheme – a fraud that lasted longer, reached wider and cut deeper than any similar scheme in history, entirely eclipsing the puny regional ambitions of Charles Ponzi, the Boston swindler who gave his name to the scheme nearly a century ago.”
 
In the Saturday/Sunday December 20-21 2008 issue of The Wall Street Journal, Robert Frank and Tom Lauricella wrote as follows about Madoff, who was arrested on December 11 after he confessed the fraud to his two sons, who turned him in. The pressure had become unbearable after some investors, wounded by the financial crisis, demanded their money, several billions. “The business, which started with a small circle of relatives and friends, was built on a simple premise: modest but steady returns regardless of market swings. Mr. Madoff’s social and business connections, and remarkably consistent returns of 10% to 12%, brought in billions of dollars from hundreds of investors.”
 
“Social and business connections” – there’s where I want you to focus. The Jews are financial kingpins on Wall Street. A large number of Madoff’s victims are, like Madoff himself, Jewish. They are prominent Jewish executives, organizations, foundations and universities. Madoff had connections. I will quote Henriques again, to give you one of the best examples of these “connections.” “He could not have had a more effective recruiter than Jacob Ezra Merkin, a lion of Wall Street who would be president of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue. Mr. Merkin’s father, Hermann, was the founding president of the synagogue and Herman Wouk, the author, wrote its constitution. As a direct descendant of the founder of modern Orthodox Judaism and a graduate of Columbia’s English department and Harvard’s law school, Mr. Merkin easily held his own in a congregation that included such luminaries as the author Elie Wiesel, the deal maker Ronald O. Perelman and Ira Rennert, a wealthy financier perhaps best known for building one of the biggest houses and compounds in the Hamptons.”
 
Almost all the money Mr. Merkin accumulated to manage in his Ascot Partners fund, ended up in the same place – in Bernie Madoff’s hands.
The story absolutely intrigues me, partly because I worked as a teenaged college student doing temporary jobs on Wall Street in the summer of 1966. I’m just giving you the smallest tip of the Madoff iceberg. The lesson for us is simple – be careful of these necktie and three-piece smoothies. Serious.

Reports Swedge of Rochester: “The pieces about being able to whistle reminded me of something my wife and her mother would do to bother each other.
“My wife can’t roll her R’s, so her mother would look at her and deliberately make a rolling-R sound. My wife would respond by whistling at her mother, as her mother couldn’t whistle. Then they would each make pouty faces. Just one of the funny things they would do together.
“I, of course, can do both of those things [Bulletin Board says: of course], so if I wanted to bother one of them, they had no retaliation on hand. I still roll my R’s at my wife to get her goat; alas, we lost her mother some years ago, so I can no longer whistle to bother her.

“All the neighbors thought she was slightly daffy.”

She already had a large dog. The kitten hadn’t been named yet, and my wife’s sister was looking for suggestions. I suggested that it was so tiny, the dog could gobble it down in one bite, so she should call it ‘Dog Food.’
“She took my idea. The next time we visited, I was surprised to learn the kitten was called ‘Alpo.’ ”

And for all of her life, she was known as ‘The Little Girl.’
“Cat loving is a family affair — except for our youngest son, who likes dogs. He swore, when he was younger, that if he ever had a dog, he was going to name it Quat … so that when the dog was outside, he could go out and call it: ‘Come, Quat!’ He now has two dogs — with mundane names: Bruno and Tank.”

“I had a hair stylist whose two cats were named Scratch and Sniff. I thought that was hilarious.
“Dog Division
“We had just gotten our second German Shorthaired Pointer, a rambunctious charming 5-month-old female. Of course, trying to come to a consensus for a name was a challenge among the five of us at home. Our mutually agreed upon requirements were that it had to be a female name, had to be a name you could holler in the hunting fields, and had to be a name that would ‘go’ with our existing dog’s name. We were sitting around watching great old movies — and when bedtime came, we still hadn’t decided on a name. Later that night, my dreams were very vivid. I pictured a blaze-orange-and-camo-clad hunter walking through wheat fields yelling ‘STELLA! STELLA!’ That image morphed into me in my pajamas running up our neighborhood street chasing after an escaped puppy, my flip-flops flopping, and me shouting ‘STELLA! STELLA!’ When we once again got around to the business of discussing names, I of course tossed in ‘Stella’ — which I believed to be a great suggestion. The family didn’t think so. And that is how Sophie got her name.”
What’s in a name?
Dog Division (responsorial)
Grandma Ellie: “Recently Nancy de Roseville mentioned that Scuppers the Sailor Dog shared their home with the first family cat.
“Her dog must have been named after the scruffy white-and-brown dog lovingly pictured in a book that our children enjoyed back in the 1960s. That book, ‘The Sailor Dog’ by Margaret Wise Brown, has survived, and now our grandchildren are sharing in the adventures of the plucky little dog who was ‘born in the teeth of a gale.’ Scuppers found out that misadventures were just opportunities to use his imagination and enjoy life on the ‘deep green sea’ — a good lesson for sailors and non-sailors alike!”
Life as we know it
Leading to: CAUTION! Words at Play!
Al B of Hartland: “When I was in grade school, I played a cloud in the school play.
“I wasn’t that excited about being a cloud. I thought I had signed up to be a clown.
“A cloud may not sound like much of a role, but I was told that there are no small parts, only small actors. Thus inspired, I took my position very seriously. I told everyone in school that I was thrilled to be a cloud and that it was the very best thing to be in the play.
“Enthusiasm makes a great salesman. Eight other students asked their teachers if they could be a cloud.
“The play required but a single cloud. There were nine of us.
“It was a pretty good play — warm and sunny in its message.
“But it was overcast.”
Hmmmmmmmm (responsorial)
Monday’s Bulletin Board included a note from Al B of Hartland: “A friend told me that he will climb anything, no matter how tall it is — as long as he is able to keep one foot on the ground.”
Which inspired a call from Walt of Wayzata: “Al B reminded me of the old story about the guy who came in to work and told his buddies that, over the weekend, he’d fallen off a 30-foot ladder. The guys all said: ‘Well, how come you don’t look more banged up than you are?’ And he said: ‘I fell off the bottom rung.’ ”
Our times (cont.)
Aunt Barbara: “Walt of Wayzata wrote: ‘On CNBC, they’re talking about Bernie Madoff, and they keep referring to it as “the crime of the century.” The century’s only 8 years old. Let’s give it a chance.’
“Perhaps they’re crossing their fingers under the desk and saying a silent prayer while reading this. I sure am.”
The darnedest things
WARNING! Cute kid story ahead, from The Old Raisin in Highland: “On Christmas Eve, I received a garden rock from my daughter, inscribed with: ‘Love begets love.’ My grandniece Simone, who’s 7 years old, came walking by, and she looked down and she said: ‘Boy, Auntie, you must be really bad! You got a rock for Christmas!’ ”

HOLLYWOOD – God bless America, and how’s everybody?
• Barack Obama was named Time magazine’s Man of the Year Wednesday. He vowed to bring the nation together. There was a time when you could pay $100 a month to avoid Oprah Winfrey but now that she has signed with HBO that’s no longer possible.
• Tom Cruise apologized on the Today Show for pushing his Scientology beliefs on depression sufferers. He also thanked his parents for all their sacrifices for his success. Three times they sacrificed a chicken and once they sacrificed a goat.
• Caroline Kennedy began campaigning actively Tuesday to be named the U.S. Senator for New York. She endorsed Barack Obama for president last January and turned the tide in his favor. Why she is not in an unmarked grave in Arkansas is anybody’s guess.
• The National Football League laid off 150 office workers Tuesday as the reality of the economy hit the sport. Crime is rampant in the league. Last Sunday a running back got penalized 15 yards for swindling a Jewish charity.
• Bernie Madoff was placed under house arrest Wednesday for swindling people who trusted him out of $50 billion. He’s restricted to his Park Avenue apartment. How much harm can he do locked in an apartment with nothing but a telephone and a Rolodex?
• SEC Chairman Chris Cox ordered a probe of his own agency Wednesday for failing to detect Bernie Madoff’s $50 billion Wall Street fraud. Al-Qaeda just called off all further operations in America. They can’t keep up with the competition.
• Inaugural officials predicted 4 million people will attend the Inauguration ceremony. Every power broker will be there. The Illinois governor will be kept out of town so in the event of a catastrophe, someone will be alive to sell the government.
• ABC News says Rod Blagojevich was a bookie with links to the mob before he was governor. Jesse Jackson Jr. just realized he was snitching on the Chicago mob. In lieu of flowers, his family is requesting that donations be made to his father’s slush fund.
• The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate to zero percent Tuesday. Lower interest rates allow you to go deeper into debt cheaply. So many people are digging a hole for themselves in Los Angeles that subway construction is two years ahead of schedule.
• The White House announced Tuesday that the U.S. and Iraq have agreed to a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal. It may leave thousands of U.S. troops on Iraqi soil for decades to come. There is an old saying in the Arab world, if the shoe fits, throw it.
• President Bush showed quick reflexes Sunday when he ducked two shoes thrown at him by an Iraqi reporter in Baghdad. It was chaotic. Throwing a shoe at someone in the Arab world is a sign of utter contempt, and the second shoe was a follow-up question.
• President Bush issued regulations Tuesday saying government agencies can ignore the Endangered Species Act. He’s tired of hearing about the plight of worms, snakes and rats. They have all their money in Swiss banks anyway.
• Wisconsin brothers Ed and Tom Shircel rolled perfect games bowling together in league play in Sheboygan on Monday. The brothers chose bowling over golf in high school. One of the advantages bowling has over golf is you seldom lose a bowling ball.

Who Wants to Kick a Millionaire?
by
Frank Rich
DURING the Great Depression, American moviegoers seeking escape could ogle platoons of glamorous chorus girls in ""Gold Diggers of 1933."" Our feel-good movie of the year is ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" a Dickensian tale in which we root for an impoverished orphan from Mumbai's slums to hit the jackpot on the Indian edition of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.""
It's a virtuoso feast of filmmaking by Danny Boyle, but it's also the perfect fairy tale for our hard times. The hero labors as a serf in the toilet of globalization: one of those mammoth call centers Westerners reach when ringing an 800 number to, say, check on credit card debt. When he gets his unlikely crack at instant wealth, the whole system is stacked against him, including the corrupt back office of a slick game show too good to be true.
We cheer the young man on screen even if we've lost the hope to root for ourselves. The vicarious victory of a third world protagonist must be this year's stocking stuffer. The trouble with ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is that it, like all classic movie fables, comes to an end - as it happens, with an elaborately choreographed Bollywood musical number redolent of ""Gold Diggers of 1933."" Then we are delivered back to the inescapable and chilling reality outside the theater's doors.
Just when we thought that reality couldn't hit a new bottom it did with Bernie Madoff, a smiling shark as sleazy as the TV host in ""Slumdog."" A pillar of both the Wall Street and Jewish communities - a former Nasdaq chairman, a trustee at Yeshiva University - he even victimized Elie Wiesel's Foundation for Humanity with his Ponzi scheme. A Jewish financier rips off millions of dollars devoted to memorializing the Holocaust - who could make this stuff up? Dickens, Balzac, Trollope and, for that matter, even Mel Brooks might be appalled.
Madoff, of course, made up everything. When he turned himself in, he reportedly declared that his business was ""all just one big lie."" (The man didn't call his 55-foot yacht ""Bull"" for nothing.) As Brian Williams of NBC News pointed out, the $50 billion thought to have vanished is roughly three times as much as the proposed Detroit bailout. And no one knows how it happened, least of all the federal regulators charged with policing him and protecting the public. If Madoff hadn't confessed - for reasons that remain unclear - he might still be rounding up new victims.
There is a moral to be drawn here, and it's not simply that human nature is unchanging and that there always will be crooks, including those in high places. Nor is it merely that Wall Street regulation has been a joke. Of what we've learned about Madoff so far, the most useful lesson can be gleaned from how his smart, well-heeled clients routinely characterized the strategy that generated their remarkably steady profits. As The Wall Street Journal noted, they ""often referred to it as a ‘black box.' ""
In the investment world ""black box"" is tossed around to refer to a supposedly ingenious financial model that is confidential or incomprehensible or both. Most of us know the ""black box"" instead as that strongbox full of data that is retrieved (sometimes) after a plane crash to tell the authorities what went wrong. The only problem is that its findings arrive too late to save the crash's victims. The hope is that the information will instead help prevent the next disaster.
The question in the aftermath of the Madoff calamity is this: Why do we keep ignoring what we learn from the black boxes being retrieved from crash after crash in our economic meltdown? The lesson could not be more elemental. If there's a mysterious financial model producing miraculous returns, odds are it's a sham - whether it's an outright fraud, as it apparently is in Madoff's case, or nominally legal, as is the case with the Wall Street giants that have fallen this year.
Wall Street's black boxes contained derivatives created out of whole cloth, deriving their value from often worthless subprime mortgages. The enormity of the gamble went undetected not only by investors but by the big brains at the top of the firms, many of whom either escaped (Merrill Lynch's E. Stanley O'Neal) or remain in place (Citigroup's Robert Rubin) after receiving obscene compensation for their illusory short-term profits and long-term ignorance.
There has been no punishment for many of those who failed to heed this repeated lesson. Quite the contrary. The business magazine Portfolio, writing in mid-September about one of the world's biggest insurance companies, observed that ""now that A.I.G is battling to survive, it is its black box that may save it yet."" That box - stuffed with ""accounting or investments so complex and arcane that they remain unknown to most investors"" - was so huge that Washington might deem it ""too big to fail.""
Sure enough - and unlike its immediate predecessor in collapse, Lehman Brothers - A.I.G. was soon bailed out to the tune of $123 billion. Most of that also disappeared by the end of October. But not before A.I.G. executives were caught spending $442,000 on a weeklong retreat to a California beach resort.
There are more black boxes still to be pried open, whether at private outfits like Madoff's or at publicly traded companies like General Electric, parent of the opaque GE Capital Corporation, the financial services unit that has been the single biggest contributor to the G.E. bottom line in recent years. But have we yet learned anything? Incredibly enough, as we careen into 2009, the very government operation tasked with repairing the damage caused by Wall Street's black boxes is itself a black box of secrecy and impenetrability.
Last week ABC News asked 16 of the banks that have received handouts from the Treasury Department's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program the same two direct questions: How have you used that money, and how much have you spent on bonuses this year? Most refused to answer.
Congress can't get the answers either. Its oversight panel declared in a first report this month that the Treasury is doling out billions ""without seeking to monitor the use of funds provided to specific financial institutions."" The Treasury prefers instead to look at ""general metrics"" indicating the program's overall effect on the economy. Well, we know what the ""general metrics"" tell us already: the effect so far is nil. Perhaps if we were let in on the specifics, we'd start to understand why.
In its own independent attempt to penetrate the bailout, the Government Accountability Office learned that ""the standard agreement between Treasury and the participating institutions does not require that these institutions track or report how they plan to use, or do use, their capital investments."" Executives at all but two of the bailed-out banks told the G.A.O. that the ""money is fungible,"" so they ""did not intend to track or report"" specifically what happens to the taxpayers' cash.
Nor is there any serious accounting for executive pay at these seminationalized companies. As Amit Paley of The Washington Post reported, a last-minute, one-sentence loophole added by the Bush administration to the original bailout bill gutted the already minimal restrictions on executive compensation. And so when Goldman Sachs, Henry Paulson's Wall Street alma mater, says that it is not using public money to pay executives, we must take it on faith.
In the wake of the Madoff debacle, there are loud calls to reform the Securities and Exchange Commission, including from the president-elect. Under both Clinton and Bush, that supposed watchdog agency ignored repeated and graphic warnings of Madoff's Ponzi scheme as studiously as Bush ignored Al Qaeda's threats during the summer of 2001.
But fixing that one agency is no panacea. All the talk about restoring ""confidence"" and ""faith"" in capitalism will be worthless if we still can't see what's going on in the counting rooms. In his role as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Timothy Geithner, Barack Obama's nominee for Treasury secretary, has been at the center of the action in the bailout's black box, including the still-murky and conflicting actions (and nonactions) taken with Lehman and A.I.G. His confirmation hearings demand questions every bit as tough as those that were lobbed at the executives from Detroit's Big Three.
On Friday, Geithner's partner in bailout management, Paulson, asked Congress to give the Treasury the second half of the $700 billion bailout stash. But without transparency and accountability in Washington's black box, as well as Wall Street's, there will continue to be no trust in the system, no matter how many cops the S.E.C. puts on the beat. Even the family-owned real-estate company of Eliot Spitzer, the former ""Sheriff of Wall Street,"" had entrusted money with Madoff.
We'll keep believing, not without reason, that the whole game is as corrupt as the game show in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" - only without the Hollywood/Bollywood ending. We'll keep wondering how so many at the top keep avoiding responsibility and reaping taxpayers' billions while relief for those at the bottom remains as elusive as straight answers from those Mumbai call centers fielding American debtors.
This wholesale loss of confidence is a catastrophe that not even the new president's most costly New Deal can set right.

HOLLYWOOD–God bless America, and how’s everybody?
• President Bush issued 19 pardons Tuesday, forgiving drug dealers and embezzlers and counterfeiters and people who lied to the Department of Housing. That wasn’t the worst of it. He also gave them a $700 billion bailout.
• Vladimir Putin’s shirtless photo defeated Barack Obama’s shirtless photo in an online poll Monday. The Russian won by two to one. We should have known the country was leaning this way when the government took over the banks and nobody said anything.
• The Dallas Cowboys had a postgame show with Roger Staubach after the last game in Texas Stadium. Half the crowd had already walked out in disgust after the Cowboys lost the game. It’s the last time Roger Staubach will ever try to follow prop comedy.
• Sarah Palin told Human Events magazine on Monday that her biggest regret as a candidate was not giving enough interviews. Every time she did an interview, Saturday Night Live got two weeks of material out of it. At the rate Sarah Palin is going she could replace Wall Street regulation as America’s funniest running joke.
• Oprah Winfrey booked the Royal Suite at the Four Seasons in Washington for the Inaugural weekend at a cost of $15,000 per night. She won’t like it. The hotel is so exclusive that television stars have to use separate drinking fountains.
• New York Congressman Gary Ackerman accused Caroline Kennedy’s promoters Sunday of shielding her like she’s Sarah Palin. It’s unfair. One’s from a dysfunctional family whose kids are all out of control while the other one’s the governor of Alaska.
• Washington D.C. big band leader Bob Hardwick was chosen Monday to perform at his sixth presidential Inaugural Gala at the Renaissance Hotel. He left a successful career in banking to be a bandleader. Sooner or later they all have to face the music.
• The Auto Club said Tuesday that gas prices reached their lowest point in five years. In addition to crashing the housing and stock markets and letting Louisiana drown, President Bush has now crippled the economies of Oklahoma and Texas. If Jefferson Davis had done this much damage to the Union the South would’ve won the war.
• Reverend Pat Robertson blasted the Bush administration in a CNN interview this week. He’s wasting his time with the 700 Club. Any guy who thinks that hurricanes are caused by Gay Day at Disney World should have his own show on the Weather Channel.
• Condi Rice urged all nations Tuesday to battle Somali pirates operating off the coast of Africa. The pirates take what they want by force and demand ransoms, then they use the cash for parties in Mogadishu with cocaine and beer and chicks. Somalia has only two postage stamps, one shows young Elvis and the other shows young President Bush.
• Bernie Madoff remained under house arrest after he admitted to swindling $50 billion. It’s not the end of the world. He could get his time in prison reduced for his work as a history teacher, lecturing other prisoners on how the pyramids were built.
• Joe Biden began touting the new administration stimulus package Monday. He was asked by the president-elect to be his personal emissary to the middle class. It has long been a tradition that the vice president represent the president at funerals.
• Barack Obama took his family to Hawaii for the Christmas holiday. The president-elect’s chief of staff decided to spend his Christmas vacation in Africa. That birth certificate has to be somewhere.

News organisations have to feign surprise to make news. In reality, it is of course no surprise that Bush would be greeted in Baghdad with all the warmth and approbation of fraudster Bernie Madoff dropping by the Palm Beach Country Club , nor that Iraq's physical infrastructure, $69bn later, is still in a worse state than before 2003.
In Arab culture, dogs and the soles of shoes are two very potent demonstrations of detestation and the intemperate. Iraqi journalist Muntadar al-Zeidi's lobbing of two well-aimed shoes at the president is a belated make-up for all the softballs thrown at him in Washington.
Zeidi has clearly epitomised Iraqi feelings across the board, with protests on the streets and support messages from Arab journalists . Ironically, many of them, including Zeidi's own TV station, are comparing his arrest with the brisk way that the Baathists had with dissent. This is a little unfair – he is still alive as far as we know, which is more than could be said for anyone who would have done that to Saddam.
But it does raise the question of how the White House managed to tame the major media in the US even without the implicit threat of shooting journalists and their families.
With a few notable exceptions like Helen Thomas , Bush's press conferences have not generated the indignation he so richly deserves from a largely quiescent White House press corps that needs government inspectors and Congressmen to tell it when it can be surprised and even occasionally indignant.
In a parochial way, one can understand why the press corps lacks indignation over Iraq's 100,000 civilian dead and over two million external refugees , plus untold more internally displaced.
But it is still surprising that so many reporters can be polite and deferential with someone who has turned the US Federal Reserve into a giant Ponzi scheme and broken the world's strongest economy. They defer humbly to someone who has contrived the deaths of 4,200 US servicemen and women in Iraq. It even failed to follow through on questions about the president's murky military record with the Texas Air National Guard while his peers were dying in Vietnam.
This intrepid press corps showed no compunction in following in minute detail Clinton's screwing around, but kept silent as Bush screwed entire nations.
Last week, a Senate report pointed the finger directly at Bush and his senior officials for authorising - indeed, ordering - torture and abuse of detainees. But no one threw any shoes.
It is that fawning quiescence that allowed Bush to tell Bob Woodward: ""I'm the commander – see, I don't need to explain – I do not need to explain why I say things. That's the interesting thing about being the president. Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something, but I don't feel like I owe anybody an explanation.""
And there we have it. Some people in the US and abroad certainly did ask why Iraq was invaded, and some who agreed with the invasion, certainly questioned its abysmal lack of foresight and planning and the totally inept conduct of the occupation. The information in these reports has been available all along. But it has to wait for a government or congressional report before it is mentioned. And still no shoes.
As Bush gives up his dude-ranch in Crawford to move into the McMansion that really suits him in Dallas, he should not be allowed to go quietly into that good night to file My Pet Goat into his presidential library. Better than throwing boots, prosecutors should be throwing the book at Bush and his accomplices."

America Needs a Period of Pain
Recessions Vital Part of Capitalist System
by
Eric Margolis
The shoes Iraqi journalist Muntader al-Zaidi threw at George W. Bush had more courage and truth in them than all of America's fawning media. Al-Zaidi reminded the world that Bush, Dick Cheney and their helpers have the blood of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis on their hands -- perhaps as many as one million.
In New York, fabled investment guru Bernie Madoff is accused of bilking clients of an astounding $50 billion while well-fed federal watchdogs snoozed.
Thanks to Madoff and Wall Street bandits, tens of millions of people have lost their life savings and retirement funds, and the world financial system is on the rocks.
Wall Street's big money con men, hedge fund Houdinis, and casino capitalists made a staggering $33.3 US billion in bonuses in 2007 alone by shady financial engineering and hawking fraudulent securities. Yet they have so far escaped prosecution. They get to keep their swag and $30-million South Hampton beach houses.
Worse is coming. Chrysler and Ford will shut plants in January. GM is next. In spite of the $13.4-billion auto industry bailout announced by President Bush last Friday, many plants may never reopen. As this column has long said, the U.S. auto industry closely resembles the old Soviet Union: Economically declining, bereft of new ideas, producing unwanted products, run by dimwitted careerist bureaucrats.
America produces the wrong cars, and far too many. The bloated auto industry must downsize. It has been selling cars only thanks to the steroid of cheap, easy credit -- in effect, almost giving them away. Now that the drug is largely cut off, sales have nosedived.
The U.S. economy has been running almost entirely on credit for a decade.
The U.S. national debt is twice America's net worth. Government and business encouraged a reckless credit binge to which the nation became addicted.
SAVINGS
Manufacturing fell to only 12% of GDP. Finance -- the shuffling of paper -- became America's leading industry. Americans saved nothing and had to borrow $1.2 trillion from China and Japan to keep the orgy of consumerism going.
Washington's response was panic, then flooding the economy with freshly printed money in hope something positive would happen. Japan made precisely the same gamble when its bubble economy collapsed in the early 1990s. Today, Japan has one of the world's highest deficits and its economy remains dead in the water.
The U.S. economy must be weaned off credit addiction. Pumping billions and billions of dollars into the economy is like mainlining more drugs to a sick junkie.
The economy needs a period of cold turkey in which remaining credit bubbles, bad debt and financial distortions are purged. This is called recession, and it's a vital part of the capitalist free market cycle.
Without a period of pain, we can't restore economic health or sanity.
But panicky American politicians plan to spend $8.5 trillion to stave off this necessary, beneficial recession. Their misguided efforts risk igniting a future firestorm of inflation that will be far more dangerous and painful than any recession.
HYPERINFLATION
That is why the European Central Bank, with vivid memories of the terrifying 1920s hyperinflation in Germany when a loaf of bread cost 80 million marks, has resisted deep interest rate cuts and printing money.
The Fed's recent slashing of U.S. interest rates to zero is a sign of utter desperation and an act of folly. Once investors realize that Europe, Canada and Asia are far safer investments than the U.S., watch for the U.S. dollar to nosedive -- as it should.
The remedy for America's economic ills is not more money but patience.
Americans must relearn the old verity that one must save for purchases and rainy days; that gambling with your home is idiotic; that there is no substitute for hard work or manufacturing; and that it's always very risky to trust politicians or financial ""professionals"" with your money.

Ce feuilleton footballistico- judiciaire n'en finit pas. Le footballeur Karim Benzema a contesté mardi devant la Cour de cassation la validité de l'enquête dans l'affaire de tentative de chantage à la sextape contre un autre international français, le milieu de terrain Mathieu Valbuena , dans laquelle il est mis en examen. Mi-décembre dernier, la cour d'appel de Versailles a validé des écoutes litigieuses entre un corbeau, qui avait appelé Valbuena en affirmant détenir une vidéo intime le concernant, et un policier sous couverture qui s'était fait passer pour l'homme de main de Valbuena.
Karim Benzema, tout comme un autre des protagonistes du dossier, Karim Zenati, un ami d'enfance de Benzema, a formé un pourvoi en cassation, estimant que le policier avait utilisé des méthodes pousse-au-crime. Dans son avis avant l'audience, l'avocat général préconise le rejet du pourvoi et donc pour la validation de la procédure, selon une source proche du dossier. L'affaire avait débuté en juin 2015, lorsque Valbuena avait reçu un appel de cet inconnu. Le maître chanteur proposait au milieu offensif de l'Olympique lyonnais de trouver un arrangement, sans évoquer le montant à payer, conduisant l'international français à déposer une plainte. Une négociation avait commencé entre un policier et l'escroc.
Djibril Cissé mis en cause ?
Un mois plus tôt, Djibril Cissé avait fait part à Valbuena de « murmures » en évoquant l'existence de cette vidéo supposément compromettante. Il a été mis en examen fin février. La justice cherche notamment à savoir dans quelles conditions Djibril Cissé a pris connaissance de la vidéo incriminée, à savoir s'il l'a seulement visionnée ou s'il l'a téléchargée sur son téléphone portable. L'enquête avait permis d'identifier les cerveaux présumés de l'entreprise de chantage, Mustapha Zouaoui et Axel Angot, qui gravitent depuis des années autour des footballeurs, ainsi que le corbeau présumé, Younès Houass. Zouaoui et Angot s'étaient ensuite tournés vers Karim Zenati, un ami d'enfance de Benzema, afin que l'attaquant du Real Madrid pousse Valbuena à payer. Ils ont été mis en examen pour tentative de chantage ou complicité et participation à une association de malfaiteurs.

75,"One Of The VECO Corruption Trials Begins Today – Will New Barbados Information Surface?
Alaska-Based VECO Is Building New Prison In Barbados
A few snippets from the Juneau Empire…
Tom Anderson bribery trial begins Monday
Attorney prepares for public scrutiny in corruption case
Former state Rep. Tom Anderson, R-Anchorage, goes on trial Monday in Anchorage, in a case which may be linked to the ongoing political corruption investigation involving VECO Corp. executives and other state legislators.
Also involved, likely without her knowledge, may be Anderson’s wife, Sen. Lesil McGuire, R-Anchorage.
(snip)
The FBI investigation in Alaska, led by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Public Integrity became publicly known in August of 2006. At that time FBI agents served search warrants on the offices of six members of the Alaska Legislature, though not Anderson, as well as VECO and other offices.
Three of the six legislators and two top VECO executives have been indicted on corruption charges. The executives have pleaded guilty, while the legislators have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.
A series of indictments, guilty pleas and legal maneuverings have kept those VECO-related issues in the news for months.
According to documents filed by U.S. attorneys to outline their case, the investigation had been in the works for more than two years before the raids.
(snip)
The charges against Anderson accuse him of using his position as a legislator, including the chairmanship of the Administrative Regulations Review, to benefit Cornell Companies, a Texas-based firm which operates private prisons.
In Alaska Cornell was seeking state approval to build a private prison and a juvenile psychiatric treatment facility, as well as regulatory changes to help its Alaska operations, which include a string of halfway houses around the state.
(snip)
Cornell is not accused of any wrongdoing, federal and Cornell officials have previously told the Empire.
Prosecutors said they expect to take a week to present their case.
At the time of the alleged bribery, Anderson, chairman of the Labor and Commerce Committee, was single but known to be romantically involved with McGuire, at the time chairwoman of the House Judiciary Committee…

76,"Corruption Trial: VECO Paid Alaska Politician US$2,500 A Month For “Consulting”
The corruption trial of disgraced Alaska politician Tom Anderson continued today with the judge being asked to admit evidence that VECO paid Anderson as a “consultant” to do nothing for $2,500 a month.
And THAT folks, is exactly why we need some answers in Barbados. VECO has shown that bribery and corruption are standard operating procedure. Why would it be any different in Barbados?
Excerpt from the Anchorage Daily News…
Tom Anderson was deep in debt and living beyond his means during the time that prosecutors say he took bribes to do the bidding of a private prison company, according to assertions in a new court filing.
Federal prosecutors Prosecutors Nick Marsh and Joe Bottini want to show jurors the former state legislator’s financial records, including tax returns, bank records and credit reports. Anderson is fighting to keep the material out of the trial, arguing that it is irrelevant.
As jury selection for the trial extends to a third day, the battle over financial records is one of several issues yet to be decided. Anderson, who served two terms in the state House but didn’t run last year, is being tried on seven felony charges, including bribery, extortion and money laundering.
Prosecutors say that Bill Bobrick, then a top lobbyist in Anchorage, set up a phony business and used it to funnel payments from Cornell Cos. to Anderson.
Among the issues before U.S. District Judge John Sedwick:
• Anderson’s work for Veco Corp. Anderson was a paid Veco consultant during the time he was in the Legislature, but he is not charged with any crime related to the Anchorage-based oil field services contractor. His defense lawyer, Paul Stockler, wants to prevent jurors from hearing a recording of a conversation in which Bobrick says Veco was paying Anderson $2,500 a month “to do nothing.”

Bernie Madoff: Profile of a Wall Street star
Bernard Madoff launched his high-flying career with a few thousands dollars    raised from summer jobs as a lifeguard and garden sprinkler installer, and    ended it in a pale blue bathrobe and slippers.
By Philip Sherwell in New York
5:57PM GMT 13 Dec 2008
Mr Madoff, 70, was a Wall Street legend before his arrest on Thursday, when two FBI agents arrived at his $5 million (£3.3 million) apartment on New York's Upper East Side.
Born to a New York Jewish family in 1938, at the age of 22 he put the $5,000 proceeds of his summer jobs into launching his first business - an investment firm. Within a decade he had developed an impressive client list.
He branched into investment banking and by the early 1990s had soared to such heights and reputation that he became chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Mr Madoff had homes in Manhattan, the upmarket New York summer haunt of the Hamptons and Palm Beach, Florida. Many of his clients were recruited at country clubs in those affluent high-society enclaves.
You had to be invited to get an ""in"" with Bernie, as friends knew him. This allure of exclusivity and reputation for impressive financial returns helped convince many investors of his financial bona fides, even though some money men raised repeated concerns about his firm's zero volatility results and lack of oversight.

80,"Fools and their money
Mon, Dec 22, 2008, 00:00
   
 
 
A FOOL and his money are easily parted, as those who invested some $50 billion (€35 billion) with New York money manager Bernie Madoff have now discovered. What may well be the biggest financial fraud in history shows that rich fools are not in short supply. Where any investment proposition sounds too good to be true, it may well be. And prudent investors generally heed that cautionary advice before making investment decisions.
Mr Madoff's wealthy clients, however, thought otherwise. They ignored financial risk in anticipation of financial reward. They focused on Mr Madoff's remarkable investment performance but failed to question just how he had achieved it. For years he had outperformed the markets, delivering above average financial returns to investors but without ever revealing a clear investment strategy. His success as a money manager should have attracted healthy scepticism and closer critical scrutiny of his investment methods. That never happened. His blue-chip clients included wealthy private investors, major European banks and hedge funds. It seems they failed to carry out adequate due diligence on his investment methods and have now paid the price.
Mr Madoff was not a financial genius. He is a self- confessed fraudster who has been charged with securities fraud. He told investigators his investment-advisory business was ""one big lie"". It was, as he acknowledged to his sons, a ""giant Ponzi scheme"", not unlike a pyramid selling operation. Quite simply, he paid high returns to early investors using money raised not from real investment returns but cash from new investors. The economic downturn changed matters. As more investors tried to redeem their investment, this fraudulent form of funding became impossible.
The collapse of the fund represents a further major blow to investor and public confidence in financial markets and comes at a critical time. The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates markets and protects investor interests, has admitted that allegations regarding Mr Madoff's wrongdoing were first raised with the SEC a decade ago. On examination, the SEC found no evidence to sustain those claims. But the Madoff scandal also represents major embarrassment for the accountancy profession, the leading lights of which were auditors of feeder funds that invested with Mr Madoff's brokerage firm. Alarmingly, this alleged $50 billion fraud, it seems, went undetected for 20 years and only came to light when Mr Madoff, effectively, turned himself in.

81,"SEC admits laxity in spotting fraud scheme
Alex Berenson and Diana B. Henriques, New York Times News Service
The Securities and Exchange Commission said last night that it had missed repeated opportunities to discover what may be the largest financial fraud in history, a Ponzi scheme whose losses could run as high as $50 billion.
The commission said it received credible allegations about the scheme at least nine years ago and will immediately open an internal investigation to examine why it had failed to pursue them aggressively.
The SEC issued the statement hours after Bernard Madoff , the Wall Street executive accused of operating the scheme, discussed the fraud with federal authorities at a meeting yesterday in New York, according to people briefed on the meeting.
Madoff kept several sets of books and false documents and lied to regulators when they questioned him in previous examinations of his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox .
Investigators never used subpoena powers to obtain information, but rather “relied on information voluntarily produced by Mr. Madoff and his firm,” Cox said.
When he was arrested last week, Madoff estimated that investors lost as much as $50 billion in the fraud, according to court filings. Madoff has said the scam was a Ponzi scheme, a type of fraud in which early investors are paid off with money from later victims, until no more money can be raised and the scheme collapses.
Over the decades, Madoff steadily expanded his circle of investors, drawing in small individual investors, charities, pension funds, prominent billionaires and European banks. Yesterday, Bank Medici of Vienna, Austria, became the latest major institution to acknowledge it was a client of Madoff's, saying it had $2.1 billion invested with him. Institutions and individuals have now reported losses of more than $20 billion.
Besides investigating Madoff, regulators are now in the embarrassing position of examining whether they should have caught him sooner.
“Our initial findings have been deeply troubling,” Cox said in his statement. The commission received “credible and specific allegations regarding Mr. Madoff's financial wrongdoing,” but did not respond aggressively.
“I am gravely concerned by the apparent multiple failures over at least a decade to thoroughly investigate these allegations or at any point to seek formal authority to pursue them,” Cox said.
Moreover, Cox said, the commission will investigate “all staff contact and relationships with the Madoff family and firm, and their impact, if any, on decisions by staff regarding the firm.” Cox added that he had ordered SEC staff to recuse themselves from the investigation if they had “more than insubstantial personal contacts with Mr. Madoff or his family.”
Stephen Harbeck, the chief executive of the Securities Investor Protection Corp., which has taken control of Madoff's firm through a trustee, said the firm appeared to have multiple sets of books and that he was unsure how much money, if any, Madoff's clients would eventually recover.
“The trustee and SIPC have been involved in this case for about 24 hours,” Harbeck said. “You're talking about an ongoing fraud that lasted for decades.”
Attorneys for Madoff declined to comment last night about Madoff's conversations with government authorities.
“We have said from the beginning that we are cooperating fully with the government investigation,” said Ira Lee Sorkin, one of the lawyers. When pressed, Sorkin said he had used “we” to refer to “the company, whose sole shareholder is Bernie Madoff.” Sorkin would not confirm that Madoff was providing first-hand cooperation.
Extensive cooperation from Madoff could substantially shorten the time it will take for regulators to track down any available assets, locate any other people who may have been involved in the fraud and determine whether investors will recover any of their losses.
The first indication that Madoff might be talking to authorities came at midmorning, when a federal judge delayed a bond hearing for Madoff that had originally been set for 2 p.m. yesterday.
At the request of federal prosecutors, the hearing was rescheduled for the same time today. No reason for the postponement was given, nor would the federal prosecutor's office or Madoff's lawyers comment on the delay.
Madoff was arrested at his apartment in Manhattan last Thursday by FBI agents, after his two sons – both of whom work for the company – reported that he had confessed to them that his money-management business was “basically, a giant Ponzi scheme” and “a big lie.”
The criminal complaint under which he was arrested charged him with a single count of securities fraud. He surrendered his passport and was released on a $10 million bond, secured by his apartment and co-signed by his wife and his brother, Peter Madoff, who was also the general counsel at his trading firm.
Once courted and cherished for his investment results and generosity, Madoff is now watching as the firm he spent his life building into a Wall Street powerhouse is being liquidated. His brother is cooperating with the army of forensic auditors and investigators scouring his records to discover how much money is missing and what happened to it.
Across the country, those who were once proud to know him are blaming him for their financial ruin. Yesterday, The New York Post featured a cover photo of Madoff with the headline, “The Most Hated Man in NY.”"

Le footballeur Karim Benzema conteste mardi devant la Cour de cassation la validité de l'enquête dans l'affaire de tentative de chantage à la sex-tape contre Mathieu Valbuena, dans laquelle il est mis en examen.
Mi-décembre dernier, la cour d'appel de Versailles a validé des écoutes litigieuses entre un corbeau, qui avait appelé Valbuena en affirmant détenir une vidéo intime le concernant, et un policier sous couverture qui s'était fait passer pour l'homme de main de Valbuena.
Karim Benzema, tout comme un autre des protagonistes du dossier, Karim Zenati, un ami d'enfance de Benzema, a formé un pourvoi en cassation, estimant que le policier avait utilisé des méthodes pousse-au-crime.
Dans son avis avant l'audience, l'avocat général préconise le rejet du pourvoi et donc pour la validation de la procédure, selon une source proche du dossier.
L'affaire avait débuté en juin 2015, lorsque Valbuena avait reçu un appel de cet inconnu. Le maître-chanteur proposait au milieu offensif de l'Olympique lyonnais de trouver un arrangement, sans évoquer le montant à payer, conduisant l'international français à déposer plainte.
Une négociation avait commencé entre un policier et l'escroc.
Un mois plus tôt, Djibril Cissé avait fait part à Valbuena de ""murmures"", en évoquant l'existence de cette vidéo supposément compromettante. Il a été mis en examen fin février.
La justice cherche notamment à savoir dans quelles conditions Djibril Cissé a pris connaissance de la vidéo incriminée, à savoir si il l'a seulement visionnée ou s'il l'a téléchargée sur son téléphone portable.
L'enquête avait permis d'identifier les cerveaux présumés de l'entreprise de chantage, Mustapha Zouaoui et Axel Angot, qui gravitent depuis des années autour des footballeurs, ainsi que le corbeau présumé, Younès Houass.
Zouaoui et Angot s'étaient ensuite tournés vers Karim Zenati, un ami d'enfance de Benzema, afin que l'attaquant du Real Madrid pousse Valbuena à payer.

Ohne Piëch hat der Konzern die Chance, hierarchische und autoritäre Strukturen zu überwinden, die ganz auf den Über-Manager Piëch zugeschnitten sind. Vieles ist längst nicht mehr zeitgemäß und dem komplexen Konzern nicht mehr angemessen. Dies hat katastrophale Fehler gezeitigt, so etwa die verfehlte Modellpolitik in den USA. Ein Autokonzern, der heute weltweit erfolgreich sein will, muss dezentral agieren. Berliner Zeitung
Das schier Unglaubliche ist geschehen – Ferdinand Piëch gibt sich geschlagen. Zwar wollte der nun zurückgetretene VW-Aufsichtsratschef nach dem ersten gescheiterten Versuch, seinen einstigen Zögling Martin Winterkorn als Konzernchef abzulösen, hintenherum doch noch das Blatt wenden. Was ihm viele Beobachter zugetraut hätten. Schließlich hat jahrelang vor allem eine Meinung bei Volkswagen gezählt – die von Piëch. Doch der Porsche-Teil des Familienclans, dem die Mehrheit der Anteile gehört, sowie die so wichtigen Arbeitnehmervertreter und das Land Niedersachsen, gegen das nichts bei VW geht, hielten Winterkorn die Treue. Schluss, aus und vorbei also für Piëch.

VW-Abgasskandal: Erneute Manipulation bei Softwareupdate?
Wer erlebt hat, wie bei VW-Veranstaltungen Piëch quasi gottgleich hofiert wurde, kann den Einschnitt für den Konzern zumindest erahnen. Aber auch bei Martin Winterkorn dürfte sich der Triumph in Grenzen halten. Zu viel ist nach der Kampfansage Piëchs über Defizite geredet worden, die auf sein Konto gehen: Zu geringe Rendite bei der VW-Kernmarke, ein mieses US-Geschäft, das Fehlen eines Billigautos, ungenügende Antworten auf die Angriffe von Google, Apple & Co auf das traditionelle Autogeschäft. Dabei geriet leicht aus dem Blick, dass es Winterkorn war, der die zwölf Marken zu einem Ganzen fügte, der den Konzern bis kurz vor die Weltspitze führte. Es kann jedenfalls gut sein, dass es doch nichts mit der für 2016 verheißenen Vertragsverlängerung für Winterkorn wird. Zwei Namen potenzieller Nachfolger dürften aber ebenso verbrannt sein – Porsche-Chef Matthias Müller und Skoda-Chef Winfried Vahland waren Piëchs Favoriten, mit denen er Winterkorn vom Chefsessel schubsen wollte. Märkische Oderzeitung
Am Ende hatte sich der Patriarch Ferdinand Piëch gründlich verzockt. Statt den VW-Vorstandschef Martin Winterkorn, den er jahrelang gefördert hatte, endgültig aus dem Sessel zu kippen, wandte sich die Affäre nun vollends gegen ihn. Im Aufsichtsrat war der eigensinnige Porsche plötzlich ziemlich allein. Zuvor hatte er die Chefmanager an der Spitze des zweitgrößten Autokonzerns der Welt kommen und gehen lassen, wie er wollte. Doch nun schlug der Konzern gegen seinen Aufseher und größten Anteilseigner zurück. Das ist eine bemerkenswerte Emanzipation vom einstigen VW-Übervater Piëch, vor allem aber eine notwendige.
Denn der Machtkampf drohte, Volkswagen ernsthaft in die Bredouille zu bringen. Nachdem Ferdinand Piëch den Clinch gegen Martin Winterkorn, hinter den sich die anderen Aufsichtsratsmitglieder geschart hatten, verloren hatte, konnte er der schmählichen Ablösung nur durch den Rücktritt zuvor kommen. Wenigstens dieser Gesichtsverlust ist dem einst genialen Ingenieur und Manager erspart geblieben. Offiziell zumindest. Ob sich der Patriarch nun allerdings mit dieser – selbst heraufbeschworenen – Niederlage wird abfinden können, ist noch nicht sicher. Mit einem riesigen Aktienpaket im Rücken könnte Piëch bereits auf der VW-Hauptversammlung am 5. Mai noch einmal für Unruhe sorgen. Zuzutrauen wäre es ihm. Im Interesse des Konzerns wäre das allerdings nicht zu hoffen. Piëch sollte wissen, wann Schluss ist.
Genug Geld und Ruhm hat er jedenfalls. Letzteren sollte er nun nicht aufs Spiel setzen. Vielleicht ist Ferdinand Piëch, Enkel des legendären Volkswagen-Konstrukteurs Ferdinand Porsche, einer der letzten großen Wirtschaftspatriarchen mit Benzin im Blut. Seine Ingenieurs-Laufbahn begann er mit der Entwicklung eines Formel-1-Motors in den 60er Jahren. Seine großen Erfolge – den Audi quattro mit Allradantrieb zu Beginn oder den Dieseldirekteinspritzer TDI zum Ende der 80er Jahre – waren bahnbrechend, technisch und auch wirtschaftlich. Andere seiner Lieblingsprojekte jedoch, wie der 1001-PS-Bugatti Veyron mit 400 Stundenkilometer Spitze, der 8-Zylinder-Passat oder das VW-Nobelmodell Phaeton, floppten dagegen ziemlich. Der Selbstherrlichkeit Piëchs hat es allerdings auch nichts ausgemacht, dass er als VW-Vorstandschef Fehlentscheidungen zu verantworten hatte. Um Volkswagen aus der Verlustzone herauszufahren, kaufte Piëch Anfang der 90er Jahre den knallharten Sanierer Ignacio Lopez ein.
Dass der Spanier interne Unterlagen vom Konkurrenten General Motors mitbrachte und vor allem die Zulieferer gnadenlos unter Druck setzte, bescherte VW Millionen-Zahlungen an den Konzern in Detroit und ein riesiges Qualitätsproblem. All das ist überwunden und die Wolfsburger sind drauf und dran, dem Branchenprimus Toyota den Rang abzulaufen. Auch Piëch wollte immer und überall die Nr. 1 sein. Allerdings ist diese Rangelei, wer an der Spitze in der Welt sitzt, ziemlich unsinnig. Der bayerische Premiumhersteller BMW zeigt, dass es nicht auf die Masse, sondern auf die Klasse seiner Fahrzeuge ankommt.
Auch ohne den Chefaufseher Piëch bleiben zudem einige Probleme des VW-Konzerns ungelöst. Das Brot-und-Butter-Auto Golf wirft kaum Rendite ab, in den USA ist man absatzschwach, anders als die deutschen Konkurrenten, und für den asiatischen Markt fehlt ein preiswerter Volkswagen. Nach dem – hoffentlich vollständigen – Rückzug von Ferdinand Piëch aus der Konzernspitze muss der gestärkte Vorstandschef Winterkorn diese Herausforderungen angehen. Ein neuer Aufsichtsratschef sollte ihm dabei Impulse geben. Ein Konzern wie Volkswagen ist national wie international zu wichtig, als dass er zum Spielball starrsinniger Patriarchen würde.

SEC Head Passes the Buck
Taking his cue from his boss, President ""The Buck Stops Anywhere Else"" Bush, embattled SEC Chairman Christopher Cox says his agency is in tip-top shape, despite presiding over an unprecedented financial meltdown and the $50 billion Bernie Madoff fraud. In his first interview since the Madoff case broke, Cox said monitoring the investment banks that went under during the financial crisis was not his agency's responsibility and that the Madoff case was ""a big asterisk"" on an otherwise strong record of enforcement. He said the agency's ""steady hand"" has been its ""signal achievement""—a veiled attack on the more active Fed and Treasury Dept.—but critics contend that Cox's proud passivity contributed to the meltdown in the first place and let crooks like Madoff raid the store without notice. He will be replaced by Obama pick Mary Schapiro next year."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors scrambled to assess potential losses from an alleged $50 billion fraud by Bernard Madoff, a day after the arrest of the prominent Wall Street trader.
Prosecutors and regulators accused the 70-year-old, who was chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market in the early 1990s, of masterminding a fraud of epic proportions through his investment advisory business, which managed at least one hedge fund.
Hundreds of people, investing with him through the firm's clients, entrusted Madoff with billions of dollars, industry experts said.
""Madoff's investors included captains of industry, corporations -- some of which are publicly traded -- that used Madoff almost as a high-yielding cash management account, endowments, universities, foundations and, importantly, many high-profile funds of funds,"" said Douglas Kass, who heads hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management.
""It appears that at least $15 billion of wealth, much of which was concentrated in southern Florida and New York City, has gone to 'money heaven,'"" he said.
For a list of companies exposed to Madoff's alleged fraud, please see:
Federal agents arrested Madoff at his apartment on Thursday after prosecutors said he told senior employees that his money management operations were ""all just one big lie"" and ""basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.""
A Ponzi scheme is an illegal investment vehicle that pays off old investors with money from new ones, and is dependent on a constant stream of new investment. Because the invested capital is not earning a sufficient return on its own, such schemes eventually collapse under their own weight.
Madoff is the founder of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, a market-making firm he launched in 1960. His separate investment advisory business had $17.1 billion of assets under management.
'BUSINESS AS USUAL?'
About a dozen angry investors gathered on Friday in the lobby of the Lipstick Building in midtown Manhattan, where the market-making firm and advisory business are headquartered, demanding to know the fate of their money.
One woman said that when she called the firm's offices on Thursday she was told it was ""business as usual.""
Another investor groused, ""Business as usual? Of course it's business as usual. We're getting screwed left and right.""
Police later evicted the small group from the building.
Individual investors were feeling the squeeze elsewhere.
""I expect to get back zero,"" said Floridian Susan Leavitt, who invested through Madoff. ""When he tells the feds he has $200 million to $300 million left out of billions, what can you expect?""
Two law firms, Milberg LLP and Seeger Weiss LLP, said Friday they had been retained by ""dozens of individual investors"" in Madoff Securities.
The two most prominent hedge funds that invested with Madoff were the $7.3 billion Fairfield Sentry Ltd, run by Walter Noel's Fairfield Greenwich Group, and the $2.8 billion Kingate Global Fund Ltd, run by Kingate Management Ltd.
Fairfield Greenwich Group said it was trying to determine the extent of potential losses and vowed to pursue recovery of any lost assets. The firm said it had been working with Madoff for nearly 20 years.
Fairfield Sentry and Kingate Global were among a small group of hedge funds to report positive returns for 2008; the average hedge fund was down 18 percent, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.
""People who came to us for portfolio construction were often already invested with Bernie Madoff. He had hundreds of clients,"" said Charles Gradante, who invests in hedge funds as a principal at Hennessee Group LLC. ""Now his whole legacy is destroyed. He was God to people.""
Prior to Madoff's arrest, investors had wondered how he was able to generate annual returns in the low double digits in a variety of market environments. Many questioned how U.S. regulators were able to ignore numerous red flags with regard to Madoff's operations.
""Many of us questioned how that strategy could generate those kinds of returns so consistently,"" said Jon Najarian, an options trader who knows Madoff and is a co-founder of optionmonster.com.
In May 2001, Barron's reported that option strategists for major investment banks said they could not understand how Madoff managed to generate the returns that he did.
""We weren't comfortable with Madoff,"" said Brad Alford, president at investment adviser Alpha Capital in Atlanta. ""We didn't understand how his strategy could generate the kind of returns it did. We will walk away from things like that.""
MORE TO COME?
U.S. stocks tumbled in early trading on Friday, with some investors citing the Madoff case as well as the failure of talks in Congress on a rescue for the U.S. auto industry. The market later rebounded, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing 0.75 percent higher for the day.
Investors overseas were reeling from the alleged fraud.
Benedict Hentsch, a Swiss private bank, said it had 56 million Swiss francs ($47 million) of exposure to Madoff's investment advisory business.
Italian bank UniCredit SpA's fund management unit, Pioneer Investments, has exposure through its Primeo Select hedge fund, two people familiar with the matter said.
Bramdean Alternatives Ltd said almost 10 percent of its holdings were exposed to Madoff, sending shares in the UK asset manager crashing.
CNBC Television reported that Sterling Equities, which owns the New York Mets baseball team, had accounts managed by Madoff.
'UNFORTUNATE SET OF EVENTS'
Madoff said ""there is no innocent explanation"" for his activities, and that he ""paid investors with money that wasn't there,"" according to the federal complaint.
Prosecutors also accused Madoff of wanting to distribute as much as $300 million to employees, family members and friends before turning himself in.
Charged with one count of securities fraud, he faces up to 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed separate civil charges.
A hearing had been scheduled for Friday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on the SEC's request to grant powers to the court-appointed receiver to oversee the entire firm, as well as on the commission's request for a firmwide asset freeze.
But the hearing was canceled after the matter was resolved, said a deputy for U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton. No other details were immediately available. The receiver, lawyer Lee Richards, had been appointed by the judge on Thursday to oversee assets and accounts of the firm held abroad.
Madoff's lawyer, Dan Horwitz, said on Thursday: ""We will fight to get through this unfortunate set of events."" His client was released on $10 million bond.
Madoff is a member of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc's nominating committee. His firm has said it is a market-maker for about 350 Nasdaq stocks.
He is also chairman of London-based Madoff Securities International Ltd, whose chief executive, Stephen Raven, said the firm was ""not in any way part of"" the New York-based market-maker.
All equity trades involving the market-making firm will be processed as usual, the Depository Trust Clearing Corp told Reuters on Friday.

Bernard Madoff: how did he get away with it for so long?
Investigators have been on Bernard Madoff’s case for nearly a decade. But    investors still lost $50 billion in what may be the largest fraud in    history. To them this is more than a crime – it’s an 'almost unimaginable    tragedy’. Tim Shipman reports from Washington
How Bernard Madoff made 'fraud' happen 
9:19PM GMT 20 Dec 2008
As if the collapse of global financial industries hadn’t thrown up enough villains already, stunned investors have a new hate figure: Bernard 'Bernie’ Madoff, the 70-year-old financier and charmer whose hedge fund ensnared wealthy Americans with the promise of record dividends. In a jaw-dropping breach of the personal trust that was supposed to grease the wheels of capitalism, he has admitted stealing $50 billion in the largest pyramid-selling scheme in history.
But for many, what cuts deepest is Madoff’s betrayal of his fellow Jews in a manner that has drawn dark parallels with an earlier time.
Jerry Reisman, a New Jersey lawyer who knew Madoff socially and is now representing 10 investors who lost $150 million, said: “Hitler tried to kill the Jews as a people. In one weekend, Bernie Madoff destroyed Jewish wealth in America as we know it. He preyed on his own community.”
As the scandal broke on December 11, the high society of Palm Beach, the playground of Florida’s millionaires, were at a charity event. “It was like the Titanic,” one guest told the author and Palm Beach resident Laurence Leamer. “The ship was sinking, and people were crying. Everybody was drunk.”
Yet what is most remarkable about Madoff is not the scale of his greed and deception, but that he got away with it for so long. US regulators have already found evidence of misconduct stretching back to the 1970s.

Bernard Madoff 'fraud': The list of the casualties
19 Dec 2008
As long ago as 1999, an independent investigator, Harry Markopolos, concluded that Madoff’s success could not be legitimate. In 1995, he sent the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the financial watchdog, a 17-page statement: “The World’s Largest Hedge Fund Is a Fraud”.
Two years later, the commission found no evidence of fraud after an investigation that seems to have involved little more than asking Madoff whether he was a crook, and accepting his answers.
SEC boss Christopher Cox last week denounced multiple failures at his agency and launched an internal investigation of the relationships between his officials and Madoff, including Eric Swanson, who had at one point been involved in monitoring Madoff’s firm and later married his niece, Shana Madoff.
The FBI and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants are probing Madoff’s auditor, whose three employees watched over the largest hedge fund in the US from a broom-cupboard office in a suburban strip mall.
US investment banks also concluded that Madoff’s profits were too good to be true. But he circumvented their suspicions by recruiting 4,000 clients with a calculated front of charm and mystery that was so successful they begged him for the chance to hand over their cash. His Ponzi scheme, as Americans call pyramid selling, saw him suck in new investors so that he could pay dividends to those whose money he had already taken.
His victims included Hollywood mogul Steven Spielberg, developer Mort Zuckerman, Fred Wilpon, owner of the New York Mets baseball team, and numerous Jewish philanthropic organisations, which have lost their endowments and seen many of their major donors ruined. In Britain, City superwoman Nicola Horlick, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland lost millions.
Madoff’s drive helped him turn a $5,000 investment (earned from working as a lifeguard and installing sprinkler systems) into a company that helped create the Nasdaq stock exchange, which he later chaired. It bought him a $21m home in Palm Beach, a $7m Park Avenue apartment in New York and houses in the Hamptons and France. He owned a 55ft yacht called, appropriately enough, Bull.
Jerry Reisman, who met him at the Glen Oaks Country Club in Westbury, New York, said: “He moved in some of the best social circles in New York. He worked the best country clubs. He was utterly charming. He was a master at meeting people and creating this aura. People looked at him as a superhero.
“People didn’t want to know what he was doing. If it’s too good to be true, it isn’t true. But people didn’t care. They were greedy.”
Smug, too. Jeffrey Gural, chairman of real estate firm Newmark Knight Frank told the New York Times that he was teased by his friends after Madoff refused to let his family invest in the fund because he would not put up a minimum of $20 million. He said: “They thought Bernie Madoff was a genius, and that anyone who didn’t give him their money was a fool.”
The revelation that they were the fools has left Madoff investors devastated.
Take screenwriter Eric Roth, who wrote Forrest Gump. On Tuesday, he found out that he had been nominated for a Golden Globe for his latest work, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a film starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett — and that he had also lost all his retirement income. “I’m the biggest sucker who ever walked the face of the Earth,” he told the Los Angeles Times.
The fallout is wrecking lives. Brad Friedman, a partner with the New York law firm Milberg LLP, is representing more than 100 clients in Britain, the USA, Hong Kong and South America. He said: “It’s horrible. It’s a human tragedy that is almost unimaginable. It is the kind of thing we haven’t seen since 1929. In many cases, people have lost all their money.
“The majority were not super rich — they were people around retirement age who lost $5m to $8m but that was the entirety of their savings. However well they may have been living previously, they now have far less money than blue collar workers. People are selling their homes.”
Jonathan Alpert, a Manhattan psychotherapist, has counselled the victims, many of whom were already depressed by the economic downturn. “This has rocked their world,” he said. “The psychological repercussions are enormous. People were already hurting from losing money the old-fashioned way. Now, there’s shock and anger. These are smart people but when it came to Mr Madoff they relied on trust. They are rattled to the core.”
Corrupted politicians usually retain some friends after their fall, but Madoff’s associates were quick to drop him. On Wednesday, he was confined to house arrest and electronically tagged after he failed to find even four people to support his bail.
His wife Ruth and brother Peter both co-signed the surety paper. His sons, Andrew and Mark, who both worked at their father’s firm and reportedly lost millions themselves, refused to help.
Those who lost money now face a long fight for justice. There may be less than $500 million of the $50 billion left. Those who invested directly with Madoff could tap a government compensation fund. Others will have to hope there is some money found in Madoff’s bankruptcy, or sue their own fund managers for negligence.
Jerry Reisman said: “There is a famous line from Jerry Maguire: 'Show me the money’. Now we’re looking for the money.”
But as they fight to uncover the full extent of Madoff’s crimes, there is another fear. Mr Reisman said: “I can’t believe that there aren’t other Madoffs out there.”
HOW MADOFF MADE IT HAPPEN
Rich families place money with wealth managers, hedge funds and private banks
After careful vetting, these professionals choose specialist fund managers. As a consistent performer over decades, Madoff is a favourite choice
Madoff’s popularity leads to specialist funds being set up to raise money to feed directly into Madoff in return for a fee
Although he says he’s investing the money, Madoff uses the inflows to pay 'profits’ back to clients
The financial crisis hits inflows and causes clients to ask for their money back. With no money to pay out, the fraud is exposed

17h30 : Alors que Karim Benzema est toujours entendu à Versailles, une nouvelle question se pose : que va faire le sélectionneur Didier Deschamps, qui doit annoncer, ce jeudi, la liste de l'équipe de France pour les matches amicaux contre l'Allemagne et l'Angleterre, les 13 et 17 novembre ?
Il lui sera difficile d’esquiver les derniers développements de cette histoire et ses possibles conséquences. Si Benzema est bien présent à Clairefontaine lundi au premier jour du rassemblement des Bleus, Deschamps et sa troupe devront en tout cas gérer une grosse agitation médiatique.  Et tout le monde guettera les moindres gestes du joueur du Real et de Valbuena.
14h45 : «Karim Benzema n’a absolument rien à se reprocher», affirme son avocat. L’attaquant français du Real Madrid entend «mettre un terme au plus tôt à la polémique née de cette affaire dans laquelle il n’a pris aucune part», ajoute Me Sylvain Cormier. « A l’évocation de son nom par la presse, Karim Benzema a immédiatement fait savoir au juge d’instruction qu’il était à la disposition des enquêteurs. C’est donc naturellement qu’il a répondu à leur convocation».

12 h 54 : Pour faire avancer leur négociation sur la ""sextape"", les maîtres-chanteurs auraient décidé de faire appel il y a quelques mois à un proche de Karim Benzema, un homme déjà connu des services de police et résidant à Lyon, où joue Valbuena depuis l’été.

89,"Jury Finds Former Alaska Politician Guilty Of Bribery – Connections To VECO And Private Prison Company Cornell Industries Inc.
Who Says That God Does Not Have A Sense Of Humour?
Former Alaskan State Representative Thomas T. (Tom) Anderson was convicted on Monday by a jury of his peers for corruptly accepting money to influence the legislative process in favour of private prison company Cornell Industries Inc. He faces a sentence of up to 125 years in prison and ironically could end up in a prison run by Cornell.
Why It Matters To Barbados
Convicted politician Thomas Anderson was also corruptly in the pay of VECO – the same company that is building the new Barbados prison. You know… the one that is $200 million dollars over budget or so, depending upon which Barbados government minister is telling the lie on any given day.
A major FBI investigation into VECO has shown that bribery and political corruption are merely standard operating procedures used by that company. Anderson was the fourth person convicted so far in an ongoing investigation that hasn’t even started to scratch the surface of the corruption surrounding Alaska-based VECO.
Barbados Prison Is Hundreds Of Millions Of Dollars Over Budget – How Much Of That Is Due To VECO’s Corrupt Acts And Political Payoffs?
Every Barbados citizen knows that when you combine VECO’s top-down corporate culture of corruption with the political corruption and payoffs that are endemic to Barbados – the cost overrun on our new prison stinks to high heaven.
As we said in our previous article Barbados Prison Builder VECO To Be Sold – Will Court Actions Stop This Attempt To Shed Liability For VECO’s Corrupt Activities? …
Barbados Attorney General Dale Marshall was quick to absolve VECO of any corrupt activities for both the jail and the previous oil terminal project. Within days of the scandal breaking, the Attorney General held a press conference to say “Everything be jus fine wit dem nice honest people from VECO. Nothin to see here folks. Move along, move along.”
Yup, the AG was quick to absolve VECO: way too quick. Outrageously too quick in fact.
The FBI investigation is not even up to speed, there are hundreds of hours of secretly recorded conversations and thousands of pages of potential evidence that haven’t yet been revealed, more arrests to come and probably some public hearings – yet the Attorney General announces that he’s looked into everything in a morning meeting and it’s all clean.
It is not over until its over Mr. Marshall – and this investigation hasn’t even started to heat up.
There is a Barbados side to the VECO corruption investigation that is just waiting to see daylight… and when it does, oh boy!"

Alaska Politicians Made CBC Caps!
Source: At Least Two Barbados Politicians Received Undeclared “Campaign Donations” From Corrupt Alaskan VECO Corporation
Alaska’s VECO Corporation is now infamous for using bribery of politicians as a standard operating procedure. In the United States, numerous US politicians and corporation executives are facing criminal charges or are under FBI investigation for receiving gifts, loans and outright payments from VECO.
Several people have already plead guilty or been found guilty, including VECO CEO and founder Bill Allen, VECO Vice-President Rick Smith and political big-shots Bill Bobrick, Tom Anderson, Pete Kott, Vic Kohring, Jim Clark and Bill Weimar.
The VECO Barbados Connection
VECO also did over half a billion US$ worth of business with the previous BLP Barbados Government – building the oil terminal and the new prison. Barbados citizens are unclear on the exact amount of tax dollars that was paid to VECO because under both the previous Arthur/Mottley BLP government and the current Thompson DLP Government, citizens have no right to know how much of their money the government spends and what for.
To give you an idea of how VECO typically operated, another one of Alaska’s senior politicians has just been charged by the FBI with various corrupt offenses. It is alleged that Senator Ted Stephens received considerations from VECO Corporation in return for sweetheart government contracts and for pushing through tax laws and other regulations that favoured VECO. Stephens also arranged for VECO to have an inside contact at the World Bank and to receive favourable treatment in an oil deal in Pakistan. Here is what he received that we know about…
- A job for his son.
- The ability to invest US$5000 in a Florida condo which was later sold for a profit of over US$100,000. (Not a bad return on $5000!!!)
- A new Jeep Cherokee vehicle for his daughter.
- A Land Rover for himself discounted by US$20,000 under list price from the CEO of VECO.
- A free generator for his chalet.
Ted Stephens and the others also received hundreds of thousands of dollars in “campaign contributions” from VECO to ensure that they would be reelected. Yup… nothing was too good for any politician who could award multi-million dollar government contracts to VECO. The corrupt company gave cash, renovated homes, bought cars, trips and condos for politicians as their standard method of operation.
That is just how VECO operated worldwide: they obtained government contracts by bribing politicians, but Barbados politicians would have you believe that none of that went on here. No Sir!
VECO’s Corrupt Bastards Club
At one point the bribes were so open that some corrupt Alaska politicians made up hats saying “CBC” – which stood for “Corrupt Bastards Club”.
This is the same VECO that the Owen Arthur/Mia Mottley BLP government of Barbados hired without open competitive bidding to build our oil terminal and our new prison. VECO had never built a prison before, but by god, they were given the contract as a gift by then Attorney General Mia Mottley and Prime Minister Owen Arthur.
Our source says that Mia Mottley received over $100,000 in undeclared “campaign contributions” from VECO Corporation that she fed into her constituency office. This is only what the folks in the office saw and is probably a fraction of the total. After all, if VECO received half-a-billion dollars in government contracts, you can bet that they paid out more than a lousy $100 grand.
Our same source says that Prime Minister Owen Arthur’s constituency office also received big money from VECO, but on the amount they are unsure. Would Arthur have accepted less than his Attorney General that he barely tolerated?
Perhaps Mr. Arthur can advise his fellow citizens from Switzerland, London or Miami – or whatever jurisdiction he ends up retiring to as he becomes a “consultant” to justify his continued income.
Former Attorney General Dale Marshall: Corrupt Bastard
And what did the Government of Barbados do when Barbados Free Press and the other blogs broke the story to the Barbados public that VECO executives and politicians were being arrested? (BFP and the blogs broke the VECO story on the island because the Barbados news media naturally wouldn’t touch a story that showed the government in a bad light.)
Well… good old Attorney General Dale Marshall announced that he would have a meeting with VECO executives to get the truth of the story… to see if any improper payments were made by VECO to Barbados government officials and politicians.
Yup… Attorney General Dale Marshall met with those VECO executives for a half an hour one morning and then held a press conference to announce that everything was on the up and up because the VECO executives said it was.
Whew! We were glad to hear that, Dale!
Dale Marshall: You corrupt bastard. You were supposed to look after the interests of your fellow citizens but instead you participated in a sham of an inquiry and then covered-up the corruption by your BLP friends.
VECO’s Corrupt Bastards Club – Barbados Chapter
So far the known membership of the CBC Barbados includes…
Owen Arthur
Mia Mottley
Dale Marshall
Arthur and Mottley are on the list because they took money from VECO. Marshall is on the list for being a corrupt bastard that covered-up for his friends.
Folks, let us know if there are others who should be on the list. Some of the BFP staff want to include current Barbados Prime Minister David Thompson for his reluctance to investigate the VECO scandal and failure to ask the FBI for access to their evidence against Barbados politicians.
We’re going to consider adding Thompson to the list, but we’d like some input from other citizens first.
Let us know what you think, folks!

It has been a fertile financial week for bigots. The astonishing scale of corruption allegedly unmasked at the offices of Wall Street fund manager Bernie Madoff has caused disproportionate pain in the Jewish community, prompting unedifying sneers on the blogosphere.
Madoff, who is thought to have lost $50bn of assets, recruited many of his private clients through informal social networks in New York, Florida and Los Angeles.
The sense of disappointment and betrayal is palpable – particularly among Jewish philanthropic organisations. Several charities have had to shut their doors overnight, including the Lappin foundation, which funded trips to Israel for children, and the Chais Family Foundation, which supports educational and health-related projects.
The Los Angeles-based Jewish Journal noted that the saga gave ""ammo to antisemites everywhere"" and highlighted mocking comments posted on a popular financial website, Dealbreaker. Another Jewish blogger, Tvzee's Talmudic Blog, complained that he had had to ""moderate out many racist comments"" after writing about Madoff.
The wrecking impact of Madoff's fraud on Jewish philanthropy has a broad impact which extends far beyond any single religious community. Gary Tobin, president of the Institute for Jewish and Community Research in San Francisco, reckons Jewish philanthropy in the US is worth about $5bn annually.
The money is spent on everything from poverty relief to educational initiatives, bridge-building between religions and community centres – which are open to people from any faith.
""I know the antisemitic websites are picking this up – they love Jewish cabals and conspiracies,"" says Tobin. ""But for most of the world, the antisemitic reaction will be minimal. This is a philanthropic and charitable tragedy – it's more sad than anything else.""
The Wall Street Journal noted that older Jewish investors put so much faith in Madoff that they jokily nicknamed him ""the Jewish bond"". Lawyers for Madoff's victims say that in a close-knit community, people put a disproportionate amount of trust in a small number of individuals. Ross Intelisano, a class-action lawyer based in New York, says: ""We've been talking to a lot of direct investors. This is a rare case in which a lot of investors we've spoken to had all their money with one firm.""
Many have lost everything overnight. Arnold Sinkin, a retired carpet-fitter in Florida, lost the nest egg of nearly $1m he built up with his wife, Joan.
""We started out by giving $5,000 to him [Madoff] in the 1970s,"" said Joan Sinkin. ""At the time, $5,000 for us was really a huge amount. I think we probably had about $1.75 left in the bank once we'd given it to him.""
The septuagenarian couple's retirement planning crashed to earth when Madoff's alleged fraud materialised last week. They will be selling their apartment in New York City and relying on their children for financial help.
On an institutional level, the impact goes far beyond any single community. Banks as far afield as Japan, Switzerland and Spain are suffering Madoff-related losses, not to mention Britain's HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland. Even Hampshire County Council somehow managed to stick part of its pension fund in Madoff's business (although everybody says he was choosy about whose money he accepted).
In New York, one secular charity destroyed by Madoff's apparent corruption is the JEHT Foundation, which stands for ""justice, equality, human dignity and tolerance"". Since 2000, the charity has promoted reform of the criminal justice system to try to reduce the rate of incarceration in the US, handing out $25m to $30m annually.
The funds of JEHT's donors, Jeanne and Kenneth Levy-Church, were managed by Madoff and have evaporated overnight. The foundation's director, Robert Crane, has the shattering task of shutting down the charity.
""We're going to cease existence at the end of January,"" Crane told me. ""All of our 24 people will lose their jobs.""
It's a pretty dismal situation – and Madoff ought to be ashamed.
""It's devastating not only for us but for the people we support,"" says Crane. ""In the areas we operate, there aren't a huge number of other funds, which makes the impact even worse.""

Manipulation beim „Gelben Engel“ Autokonzerne empört über ADAC-Betrug
Nach Manipulationen bei der Vergabe des Publikumspreises „Gelber Engel“ fordert die Industrie lückenlose Aufklärung. Gibt Volkswagen den Preis zurück?

© dpa Beschädigter Publikumspreis: Beim „Gelben Engel“ 2014 wurde manipuliert
Zuerst hat der ADAC den Autopreis „Gelber Engel“ manipuliert und dann die Öffentlichkeit belogen, um am Sonntag doch die Betrugsvorwürfe einzugestehen. Zwar trat der Kommunikationschef des ADAC mit sofortiger Wirkung zurück , aber die schwere Vertrauenskrise ist damit noch nicht behoben. Mehrere Manager großer Autokonzerne forderten von Deutschlands bedeutendstem Autoclub mit seinen fast 19 Millionen Mitgliedern lückenlose Aufklärung und neue, transparente Strukturen.
Autor: Johannes Ritter, Korrespondent für Politik und Wirtschaft in der Schweiz. Folgen:
Auch ADAC-Geschäftsführer Karl Obermair steht in der Kritik. Er hatte am vergangenen Donnerstag, als die Manipulationsvorwürfe längst öffentlich waren, die „Gelben Engel“ verliehen und in der offiziellen Feier vor versammelter Autoindustrie noch von „Unterstellungen und Unwahrheiten“ gesprochen. Damit nicht genug, verspottete Obermair gar die „Süddeutsche Zeitung“, die über Mauscheleien im ADAC berichtet hatte : Immerhin habe das Blatt die vier Buchstaben des ADAC richtig abgedruckt. Das sorgte unter Teilnehmern der Veranstaltung für heftige Kritik. „Im Lichte der neuen Erkenntnisse hat er sich mit diesen Äußerungen selbst beschädigt“, sagte ein Automanager.
Abwarten in Wolfsburg
Besonders groß ist der Ärger im Volkswagen-Konzern, dessen VW Golf vom ADAC in der Kategorie „das Lieblingsauto der Deutschen“ prämiert wurde. „Die absolute Zahl der abgegebenen Stimmen“ sei „geschönt“ worden, nicht aber die Rangfolge der Ergebnisse, teilte der ADAC am Sonntag mit. Diese Manipulation habe Kommunikationschef und „Motorwelt“-Chefredakteur Michael Ramstetter gegenüber der ADAC-Geschäftsführung und dem Präsidium am Tag nach der Preisverleihung eingeräumt und seinen Rücktritt erklärt. Ramstetter muss deswegen mit juristischen Schritten rechnen.

Behält Volkswagen den Preis? VW-Chef Martin Winterkorn mit dem „Gelben Engel“
BMW und VW mahnten Klarheit und Transparenz an. „Der ADAC muss diese Vorgänge vollständig aufklären“, sagte ein VW-Sprecher der Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung. Die Frage, ob VW den nunmehr beschädigten Preis „Lieblingsauto der Deutschen“ zurückgeben werde, ließ er offen. Offenbar wollen die Wolfsburger zunächst abwarten, welche Ergebnisse die weitere Aufklärungsarbeit zutage fördert. Zugleich wies der VW-Sprecher darauf hin, dass der Golf das meistverkaufte Auto in Deutschland und daher auch unabhängig von Fehlern bei der ADAC-Preisvergabe objektiv das Lieblingsauto der Deutschen sei.
ACE kritisiert „aufgeblasene Selbstinszenierung“
Wie objektiv es bei den seit zehn Jahren verliehenen ADAC-Preisen zugegangen ist, wird in der Branche nun mehr denn je bezweifelt. „Das ist alles ein großer Mist“, sagte ein verärgerter Manager eines Automobilkonzerns. Schon bei der Preisvergabe im vergangenen Jahr soll der Verdacht aufgekommen sein, dass es in der „Lieblingsauto“-Kategorie womöglich nicht mit rechten Dingen zugegangen sei. Damals hatte die A-Klasse von Mercedes gewonnen, obwohl auch in jenem Jahr der Golf das meistverkaufte Auto war. Offenbar muss es ADAC-Kommunikationschef Ramstetter peinlich gewesen sein, dass bei fast 19 Millionen Lesern der ADAC-Mitgliederzeitung „Motorwelt“ weniger als 4000 Stimmen ausreichten, damit der VW Golf die Leserwahl gewinnen konnte – als manipuliertes Endergebnis für den „Gelben Engel 2014“ wies der ADAC mit 34299 Stimmen aus. Die tatsächliche Zahl lässt der ADAC nach Aussage eines Sprechers jetzt ermitteln.
Der Auto Club Europa ( ACE ) stellt nun derartige Auszeichnungen für die Automobilbranche in Frage. Sie seien überflüssig und das Ganze eine „aufgeblasene Selbstinszenierung“ des ADAC. Stefan Bratzel, Leiter des Center of Automotive in Bergisch-Gladbach, wirft dem ADAC Hybris vor: „Der ADAC hat sich größer gemacht als er ist. Das hätte er doch gar nicht nötig gehabt“, sagte Bratzel der Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung. Der Verein habe als Interessenvertreter der Autofahrer gegenüber der Politik viel Vertrauen verspielt. So mancher Politiker werde fragen, ob die Datenbasis, auf welcher dieser Lobby-Verein argumentiere, überhaupt stimme. „Nicht jeder, der einen Schutzbrief hat, verfolgt automatisch die gleichen Interessen wie der ADAC“, sagte Bratzel. Bundesverkehrsminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) sagte, die Vorgänge beim ADAC zeigten, dass „großen Verbänden manchmal etwas mehr Bescheidenheit im Auftreten gut täte“. Hinter vorgehaltener Hand verweisen Automanager auf strukturelle Probleme innerhalb des ADAC: „Hier haben alle Kontrollmechanismen versagt.“

Alaska Politicians Made CBC Caps!
Source: At Least Two Barbados Politicians Received Undeclared “Campaign Donations” From Corrupt Alaskan VECO Corporation
Alaska’s VECO Corporation is now infamous for using bribery of politicians as a standard operating procedure. In the United States, numerous US politicians and corporation executives are facing criminal charges or are under FBI investigation for receiving gifts, loans and outright payments from VECO.
Several people have already plead guilty or been found guilty, including VECO CEO and founder Bill Allen, VECO Vice-President Rick Smith and political big-shots Bill Bobrick, Tom Anderson, Pete Kott, Vic Kohring, Jim Clark and Bill Weimar.
The VECO Barbados Connection
VECO also did over half a billion US$ worth of business with the previous BLP Barbados Government – building the oil terminal and the new prison. Barbados citizens are unclear on the exact amount of tax dollars that was paid to VECO because under both the previous Arthur/Mottley BLP government and the current Thompson DLP Government, citizens have no right to know how much of their money the government spends and what for.
To give you an idea of how VECO typically operated, another one of Alaska’s senior politicians has just been charged by the FBI with various corrupt offenses. It is alleged that Senator Ted Stephens received considerations from VECO Corporation in return for sweetheart government contracts and for pushing through tax laws and other regulations that favoured VECO. Stephens also arranged for VECO to have an inside contact at the World Bank and to receive favourable treatment in an oil deal in Pakistan. Here is what he received that we know about…
- A job for his son.
- The ability to invest US$5000 in a Florida condo which was later sold for a profit of over US$100,000. (Not a bad return on $5000!!!)
- A new Jeep Cherokee vehicle for his daughter.
- A Land Rover for himself discounted by US$20,000 under list price from the CEO of VECO.
- A free generator for his chalet.
Ted Stephens and the others also received hundreds of thousands of dollars in “campaign contributions” from VECO to ensure that they would be reelected. Yup… nothing was too good for any politician who could award multi-million dollar government contracts to VECO. The corrupt company gave cash, renovated homes, bought cars, trips and condos for politicians as their standard method of operation.
That is just how VECO operated worldwide: they obtained government contracts by bribing politicians, but Barbados politicians would have you believe that none of that went on here. No Sir!
VECO’s Corrupt Bastards Club
At one point the bribes were so open that some corrupt Alaska politicians made up hats saying “CBC” – which stood for “Corrupt Bastards Club”.
This is the same VECO that the Owen Arthur/Mia Mottley BLP government of Barbados hired without open competitive bidding to build our oil terminal and our new prison. VECO had never built a prison before, but by god, they were given the contract as a gift by then Attorney General Mia Mottley and Prime Minister Owen Arthur.
Our source says that Mia Mottley received over $100,000 in undeclared “campaign contributions” from VECO Corporation that she fed into her constituency office. This is only what the folks in the office saw and is probably a fraction of the total. After all, if VECO received half-a-billion dollars in government contracts, you can bet that they paid out more than a lousy $100 grand.
Our same source says that Prime Minister Owen Arthur’s constituency office also received big money from VECO, but on the amount they are unsure. Would Arthur have accepted less than his Attorney General that he barely tolerated?
Perhaps Mr. Arthur can advise his fellow citizens from Switzerland, London or Miami – or whatever jurisdiction he ends up retiring to as he becomes a “consultant” to justify his continued income.
Former Attorney General Dale Marshall: Corrupt Bastard
And what did the Government of Barbados do when Barbados Free Press and the other blogs broke the story to the Barbados public that VECO executives and politicians were being arrested? (BFP and the blogs broke the VECO story on the island because the Barbados news media naturally wouldn’t touch a story that showed the government in a bad light.)
Well… good old Attorney General Dale Marshall announced that he would have a meeting with VECO executives to get the truth of the story… to see if any improper payments were made by VECO to Barbados government officials and politicians.
Yup… Attorney General Dale Marshall met with those VECO executives for a half an hour one morning and then held a press conference to announce that everything was on the up and up because the VECO executives said it was.
Whew! We were glad to hear that, Dale!
Dale Marshall: You corrupt bastard. You were supposed to look after the interests of your fellow citizens but instead you participated in a sham of an inquiry and then covered-up the corruption by your BLP friends.

Folks, let us know if there are others who should be on the list. Some of the BFP staff want to include current Barbados Prime Minister David Thompson for his reluctance to investigate the VECO scandal and failure to ask the FBI for access to their evidence against Barbados politicians.
We’re going to consider adding Thompson to the list, but we’d like some input from other citizens first.

Corruption Trial: VECO Paid Alaska Politician US$2,500 A Month For “Consulting”
The corruption trial of disgraced Alaska politician Tom Anderson continued today with the judge being asked to admit evidence that VECO paid Anderson as a “consultant” to do nothing for $2,500 a month.
And THAT folks, is exactly why we need some answers in Barbados. VECO has shown that bribery and corruption are standard operating procedure. Why would it be any different in Barbados?
Excerpt from the Anchorage Daily News…
Tom Anderson was deep in debt and living beyond his means during the time that prosecutors say he took bribes to do the bidding of a private prison company, according to assertions in a new court filing.
Federal prosecutors Prosecutors Nick Marsh and Joe Bottini want to show jurors the former state legislator’s financial records, including tax returns, bank records and credit reports. Anderson is fighting to keep the material out of the trial, arguing that it is irrelevant.
As jury selection for the trial extends to a third day, the battle over financial records is one of several issues yet to be decided. Anderson, who served two terms in the state House but didn’t run last year, is being tried on seven felony charges, including bribery, extortion and money laundering.
Prosecutors say that Bill Bobrick, then a top lobbyist in Anchorage, set up a phony business and used it to funnel payments from Cornell Cos. to Anderson.
Among the issues before U.S. District Judge John Sedwick:
• Anderson’s work for Veco Corp. Anderson was a paid Veco consultant during the time he was in the Legislature, but he is not charged with any crime related to the Anchorage-based oil field services contractor. His defense lawyer, Paul Stockler, wants to prevent jurors from hearing a recording of a conversation in which Bobrick says Veco was paying Anderson $2,500 a month “to do nothing.”

For news details Read on : Our children deserved better
While identifying the causes of illiteracy in Pakistan, the Education Development Society has rightly said that unless there is accountability and sustainable policies, things would continue to slide downhill. The problems are myriad. There is the issue of a ridiculously small budget allocated for the education sector. And then, even the funds received from various donor agencies for improvement of education are either misappropriated or remain unutilized. As a consequence, they generally get withdrawn in the end. The curriculum taught in public sector schools is a nightmare. The courses approved and disseminated by the text book boards through printing done by their contractors are of abysmally poor quality, both in content and presentation. Most criminal of all, the information provided in the books is often selected and vetted to suit the regime in power. The teaching staff is low-paid, untrained and, naturally, non-committed. Most teachers are teaching part time, often holding other jobs that are more gainful, seldom attending school and doing as good as nothing when they do. They only appear on the pay-day to receive their salaries, often after giving a cut to the head of their institution as a quid pro quo for ignoring their laxity in job.
In Sindh, unfortunately, even those districts that were at par with urban areas before independence have fallen behind and, indeed, seem to have suffered the most. The Asian Development Bank had stipulated about $97million for 'Decentralised Elementary Education project but had to withdraw it because of the poor performance of the education department (as reported in media on January 31). Moreover, because of corrupt practices prevalent in the education department of Sindh, some 6,649 'ghost schools and 7,490 'skeleton schools scattered all across the province were found in a survey of the Sindh Education and Literacy Department. Even as per the government figures in Sindh, there are more than 5700 ghost schools. On paper, these ghost schools exist with a fully working staff that receive salaries and maintenance funds on a regular basis. In reality, though, the teachers bunk, or simply never report for duty while the buildings of these schools are used by influential people as their godowns, barns or cattle pens. -ALTAF AHMED, Hyderabad, February 18 .

LE SCAN SPORT - Récidiviste, l'international français a été flashé par un radar mobile à une vitesse excessive, à proximité de Madrid.
Karim Benzema a de nouveaux soucis avec la justice espagnole. Le buteur du Real Madrid a été entendu mardi par un juge d'Alcobendas, une ville proche de la capitale espagnole, en raison d'un présumé «crime contre la sécurité routière», rapporte la presse ibérique. L'ancienne star de l'Olympique Lyonnais a été flashée par un radar mobile au cours des dernières semaines. A sa sortie du tribunal, Karim Benzema n'a pas souhaité s'exprimer sur la nature exacte de l'infraction.
Récidiviste
Déjà en 2013, l'attaquant madrilène avait été contrôlé à 216 km/h sur une voie limité à 100 km/h. Karim Benzema avait alors écopé d'une amende de 36.000 euros accompagnée d'une suspension de permis d'une durée de huit mois. En 2011, l'international français avait également été sanctionné pour «conduite imprudente» à Ibiza. L'année de son arrivée à Madrid, en 2009, Karim Benzema a connu deux accidents sans gravité. Un dans la capitale espagnole et l'autre sur l'île de la Réunion, avec une Lamborghini.
Aujourd'hui, l'attaquant français possède une Bugatti Veyron d'une valeur d'environ deux millions d'euros. Considérée comme la voiture de série la plus rapide au monde, le bolide du constructeur français possède un moteur de 1200 chevaux et peut dépasser les 400km/h.

Plongée dans l’univers tortueux liant crime organisé et football professionnel avec le livre de trois journalistes français : "" Les Parrains du foot ""
Pour qui aime le ballon rond et les faits divers, voici un Graal: un vrai ouvrage d’investigation sur les dessous criminels qui entourent football professionnel.
Avec ""Les Parrains du foot"", Mathieu Grégoire (L’Équipe), Stéphane Sellami (Le Point) et Brendan Kemmet (journaliste indépendant) signent une enquête longue de trois ans et mènent une archéologie judiciaire complètement remise à jour des tares du football, principalement français.
De la Belgique, il n’est (malheureusement) pas question, hormis quand il s’agit de parler du célèbre Francis le Belge… qui n’a jamais été belge.
À l’origine de ces 392 pages denses, la constatation que les mondes des voyous et des footballeurs se croisaient. ""Ca fait une dizaine d’année, en travaillant sur le banditisme, que l’on s’est rendu compte qu’un footballeur lensois servait d’homme de paille pour des truands en cavale. Que footballeurs et truands avaient souvent les mêmes centres d’intérêts, les boîtes de nuit, les belles bagnoles, la Côte d’Azur. On a eu envie de creuser cela. On a aussi assisté à l’arrivée des narcotrafiquants des cités françaises. Beaucoup de choses se disaient, peu étaient écrites"", rappelle Brendan Kemmet.
Résultat, sur un mode de fait-diversier ""à l’ancienne"", les trois auteurs ont sollicité leurs sources du monde judiciaire et policier. Et soulevé de vieux lièvres, tel la présence de Richard Casanova, truand de la Brise de Mer présent près de l’Olympique de Marseille dès 1986.

Le bouquin revient ainsi sur des noms bien connus. Ceux des amitiés récentes de Franck Ribéry ou Karim Benzema, qui leur ont coûté bien cher. Ou ceux encore de Rolland Courbis, Bernard Tapie. Parmi les clubs plus ciblés que les autres, le Sporting club de Bastia et surtout l’Olympique de Marseille où ""le changement récent de propriétaires a sans doute assaini les choses"", constate Brendan Kemmet.
Le bouquin est touffu, précis, argumenté, sourcé à de multiples reprises. Et se veut d’abord un livre d’investigation qui parle de foot. Et pas l’inverse. ""Ce que l’on évoque reste un tabou dans le milieu du foot"", poursuit Kemmet. Qui affirme que la rédaction de cette enquête a été menée sans ennuis. ""C’est aujourd’hui que des gens sont mécontents de voir leur nom publiés. On a des petites pressions"", reconnaît-il.
Une fois le livre refermé, on se met à rêver à tout ce qui reste encore caché dans le petit monde du ballon rond. ""J’estime que l’on a effleuré le truc. Le grand tabou, c’est aujourd’hui les voyous des cités. Les vainqueurs de la Coupe du monde sont des cibles potentielles et chaque joueur qui sort d’une cité a le voyou de son environnement qui le rattrape"", achève Kemmet, en prenant l’exemple du récent transfert d’Ousmane Dembélé à Barcelone, lui dont l’agent est un repris de justice. Une piste pour un prochain opus? Probablement. Restera aussi à s’intéresser de plus près à la Belgique qui n’a pas été épargnée — et ne l’est toujours pas – par les assauts répétés de milieux interlopes.

Parking meters going, going, gone?
Council discussion
Steve Newman, Renfrew Mercury
Renfrew Reeve Audrey Green provides her opinion on parking meters downtown. Looking on, from left, are councillors Tom Anderson and Jim Miller.
next play/pause pre
Renfrew Mercury
It’s hard to say if the parking meters will go the way of the dinosaur, and disappear for good.
But that’s the hope of the Renfrew Business Improvement Area, a group of town businesses that have successfully lobbied for removal of parking meters in downtown Renfrew and development by senior members of town staff of an “enhanced bylaw enforcement program.” 
The motion passed at Monday night’s council meeting calls for removal of the downtown parking meters by the end of 2012.
The implementation program, according to the motion, “may provide for a one-year trial period.”
The meters will likely be removed by October or November, with the possibility the meters won’t return. Ironically, the town has delayed paying for the metering equipment. That outstanding bill is about $110,000.
A motion brought before council, after all council members presented his or her thoughts on parking meters downtown Monday, wasn’t an official recorded vote.
But Andrew Evans and Jim Miller were the only two councillors not to support the motion, which called for removal of the meters by year’s end and development of a more diligent bylaw enforcement strategy for drivers who don’t abide by time restrictions when parking downtown.
Five council members supported the motion — Mayor Bill Ringrose, Reeve Audrey Green, and councillors Gail Cole, Clint McWhirter and Tom Anderson.
About 15 members of the public sat in the audience, including Renfrew BIA chair Lisa Vincent, who was extremely pleased by the decision.
“Obviously we’re thrilled,” said Vincent. “We hoped we had the support of council, and it shows the concerns of our members are heard and are considered serious and compelling.”
As for what the future holds for downtown metering, Vincent speculated the motion will resolve a lot of related problems.
It’s time that enforcement was stricter, said Vincent, noting it was “resoundingly clear (from discussions during the public meeting, in particular) that there needs to be reinforcement because the fines (that few people pay) are looked on as a joke.”
Whatever happens, improved enforcement is a key part of the motion, said Mayor Ringrose. The mayor said higher fines, which will be shouldered by those ticketed for parking infractions, will leave the appropriate message.
EVANS' SUGGESTIONS
Evans suggested property be set aside so employers and employees of downtown businesses have a suitable place to park at a suitable price, of $30 or so per month.
If enough of those parking spots aren’t available, near the main street, then he suggested the town look at buying additional property for that purpose.
Evans said his suggestions, for a sustainable downtown parking plan, were based on opinions he garnered from council, BIA members and the public at large.
Parking areas or passes or business employers and employees could still be developed by the town, as they have been in the recent past. The same suggestion was made at the March 19 public meeting by Bob Flynn, owner of the downtown business, The Korner Hutch.
The new motion, however, could have long-term negative financial implications, said Evans following Monday’s vote. “There wasn’t enough back-and-forth (discussion). They (council members) took the easy way out … this is going to cost us money.”
Coun. Miller said he wasn’t distraught about the motion, just disappointed. The local residents he spoke to didn’t feel parking meters were a problem, but they were concerned about how some paid their fines and others ignored them.
“I don’t think we resolved anything. I don’t think the parking meters are a detriment to business downtown, I really don’t,” said Miller.
Other council members spoke out in strong support of all or most of the BIA’s recommendations brought forth in the March 19 meeting.
At the outset of Monday’s (March 26) discussion on parking meters, Mayor Ringrose announced: “Now it’s council’s turn to propose something and take a stand.”
Coun. Anderson strongly supported removal of the meters before year’s end for a 12-month trial, a three-hour time limit for anyone parked on the main street, and the town’s adoption of a provincial offences bylaw ticketing system.
NOT MAKING MONEY
Coun. Cole prefaced her remarks with the comment, “I’ve heard many people say we have the nicest downtown in Ontario. And credit is due to the business people in downtown and the BIA.”
Cole added that she wanted to see that reputation maintained by listening to what the BIA is recommending and pursuing a 12-month trial of no parking meters.
Rigid and effective enforcement of the town’s bylaws (for parking and other issues) is also needed, said Cole.
“And just to be clear, we’re not making money in parking,” added Cole.
She also stressed that the town isn’t making money on the parking meters. The town receives about $80,000 in parking revenue over 12 months, but the annual payout of $38,000 for a Renfrew Victoria Hospital equipment program often comes from the parking fund as well as local taxes, noted Cole.
In 2011, for example, $11,853 came from the parking fund, with the remaining $26,000 and change coming from the local tax levy. The year 2012 is the last of 10 years of the town’s annual contributions to the hospital.
MCwHIRTER’S RESPONSE
Coun. McWhirter said the bottom line is that BIA members should know what’s best for its members, and that it behooves council members to listen to the BIA’s recommendations, including a trial with no parking meters.
He also asked for bylaw enforcement to “put teeth into the tickets” because the current system is a disservice to the town.
Reeve Green said she agreed with the BIA’s recommendations. Green said she supported the hiring of an outside firm for bylaw enforcement because town staff is already busy enough with other work.
